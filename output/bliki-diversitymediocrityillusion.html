<p>I've often been involved in discussions about deliberately
  increasing the diversity of a group of people. The most common case
  in software is increasing the proportion of women. Two examples are
  in hiring and conference speaker rosters where we discuss trying to
  get the proportion of women to some level that's higher than usual.
  A common argument against pushing for greater diversity is that it
  will lower standards, raising the spectre of a diverse but mediocre
  group.</p>

<p>To understand why this is an illusionary concern, I like to
  consider a little thought experiment. Imagine a giant bucket that
  contains a hundred thousand marbles. You know that 10% of these
  marbles have a special sparkle that you can see when you carefully
  examine them. You also know that 80% of these marbles are blue and
  20% pink, and that sparkles exist evenly across both colors <a href="#footnote-sparkle">[1]</a>. If you were
  asked to pick out ten sparkly marbles, you know you could
  confidently go through some and pick them out. So now imagine you're
  told to pick out ten marbles such that five were blue and five were
  pink.</p>
<img src="images/diversityMediocrityIllusion/sketch.png">
<p>I don't think you would react by saying &#8220;that's impossible&#8221;.
  After all there are two thousand pink sparkly marbles in there,
  getting five of them is not beyond the wit of even a man. Similarly
  in software, there may be less women in the software business, but
  there are still enough good women to fit the roles a company or a
  conference needs.</p>

<p>The point of the marbles analogy, however, is to focus on the
  real consequence of the demand for 50:50 split. Yes it's possible to
  find the appropriate marbles, but the downside is that it takes
  longer. <a href="#footnote-non-binary">[2]</a></p>

<p>That notion applies to finding the right people too. Getting
  a better than base proportion of women isn't impossible, but it does
  require more work, often much more work. This extra effort
  reinforces the rarity, if people have difficulty finding good
  people as it is, it needs determined effort to spend the extra time
  to get a higher proportion of the minority group &#8212; even if you are
  only trying to raise the proportion of women up to 30%, rather than
  a full 50%.</p>

<p>In recent years we've made increasing our diversity a high
  priority at ThoughtWorks. This has led to a lot of effort trying to
  go to where we are more likely to run into the talented women we are
  seeking: women's colleges, women-in-IT groups and conferences. We
  encourage our women to speak at conferences, which helps let other
  women know we value a diverse workforce. </p>

<p>When interviewing, we make a point of ensuring there are women
  involved. This gives women candidates someone to relate to, and
  someone to ask questions which are often difficult to ask men. It's
  also vital to have women interview men, since we've found that women
  often spot problematic behaviors that men miss as we just don't have
  the experiences of subtle discriminations. Getting a diverse group
  of people inside the company isn't just a matter of recruiting, it
  also means paying a lot of attention to the environment we have, to try to
  ensure we don't have the same <a href="AlienatingAtmosphere.html">AlienatingAtmosphere</a> that
  much of the industry exhibits. <a href="#footnote-client-atmosphere">[3]</a></p>

<p>One argument I've heard against this approach is that if everyone
  did this, then we would run out of pink, sparkly marbles. We'll know
  this is something to be worried about when women are paid
  significantly more than men for the same work.</p>

<p>One anecdote that stuck in my memory was from a large,
  traditional company who wanted to improve the number of women in
  senior management positions. They didn't impose a quota on
  appointing women to those positions, but they did impose a quota for
  women on the list of candidates. (Something like: "there must be at
  least three credible women candidates for each post".) This
  candidate quota forced the company to actively seek out women
  candidates. The interesting point was that just doing this, with no
  mandate to actually appoint these women, correlated with an increased
  proportion of women in those positions.</p>

<p>For conference planning it's a similar strategy:  just putting out a call for
  papers and saying you'd like a diverse speaker lineup isn't enough.
  Neither are such things as blind review of proposals (and I'm not
  sure that's a good idea anyway). The important thing is to seek out
  women and encourage them to submit ideas. Organizing conferences is
  hard enough work as it is, so I can sympathize with those that don't
  want to add to the workload, but those that do can get there. <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/09/how-we-got-40-female-speakers-at-flowcon/">FlowCon
  is a good example</a> of a conference that made this an explicit
  goal and did far better than the industry average (and in case you
  were wondering, there was <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/12/flowcon-2013-wrap-up/">no
  difference between men's and women's evaluation scores</a>). </p>

<p>So now that we recognize that getting greater diversity is a
  matter of application and effort, we can ask ourselves whether the
  benefit is worth the cost. In a broad professional sense, I've
  argued that it is, because our <a href="DiversityImbalance.html">DiversityImbalance</a> is
  reducing our ability to bring the talent we need into our profession,
  and reducing the influence our profession needs to have on society.
  In addition I believe there is a moral argument to push back against
  long-standing wrongs faced by
  <a href="HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst.html">HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst</a> groups. </p>

<p>Conferences have an important role to play in correcting this
  imbalance. The roster of speakers is, at least subconsciously, a
  statement of what the profession should look like. If it's all white
  guys like me, then that adds to the <a href="AlienatingAtmosphere.html">AlienatingAtmosphere</a>
  that pushes women out of the profession. Therefore I believe that
  conferences need to strive to get an increased proportion of
  historically-discriminated-against speakers. We, as a profession,
  need to push them to do this. It also means that women have an
  extra burden to become visible and act as part of that better
  direction for us. <a href="#footnote-burden">[4]</a></p>

<p>For companies, the choice is more personal. For me,
  ThoughtWorks's efforts to improve its diversity are a major factor
  in why I've been an employee here for over a decade. I don't think
  it's a coincidence that ThoughtWorks is also a company that has a
  greater open-mindedness, and a lack of political maneuvering, than most of the
  companies I've consulted with over the years. I consider those
  attributes to be a considerable competitive advantage in attracting
  talented people, and providing an environment where we can
  collaborate effectively to do our work. </p>

<p>But I'm not holding ThoughtWorks up as an example of perfection.
  We've made a lot of progress over the decade I've been here, but we
  still have a long way to go. In particular we are very short of
  senior technical women. We've introduced a number of programs around
  networks, and leadership development, to help grow women
  to fill those gaps. But these things take time - all you have to do
  is look at our <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq">Technical Advisory Board</a>
  to see that we are a long way from the ratio we seek. </p>

<p>Despite my knowledge of how far we still have to climb, I can
  glimpse the summit ahead. At a recent AwayDay in Atlanta I was
  delighted to see how many younger technical women we've managed to
  bring into the company. While struggling to keep my head above water
  as the sole male during a late night game of <a href="/articles/eurogames/">Dominion</a>, I enjoyed a
  great feeling of hope for our future.</p>
