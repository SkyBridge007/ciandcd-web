<p>Data Lake is a term that's appeared in this decade to describe
  an important component of the data analytics pipeline in the world of
  <a href="/articles/bigData/">Big Data</a>. The idea is to
  have a single store for all of the raw data that anyone in an
  organization might need to analyze. Commonly people use
  Hadoop to work on the data in the lake, but the concept is broader
  than just Hadoop.</p>

<p>When I hear about a single point to pull together all the data
  an organization wants to analyze, I immediately think of the notion
  of the data warehouse (and data
  mart <a href="#footnote-mart-v-warehouse">[1]</a>). But there is a vital distinction between the
  data lake and the data warehouse. The data lake stores <i>raw</i>
  data, in whatever form the data source provides. There is no
  assumptions about the schema of the data, each data source can use
  whatever schema it likes. It's up to
  the consumers of that data to make sense of that data for their own
  purposes.</p>

<img src="images/dataLake/contrast.png" width="600px">
<p><i></i></p>
<p>This is an important step, many data warehouse initiatives didn't
  get very far because of schema problems. Data warehouses tend to
  go with the notion of a single schema for all analytics needs, but
  I've taken the view that a single unified data model is impractical
  for anything but the smallest organizations. To model even a
  slightly complex domain you need multiple
  <a href="BoundedContext.html">BoundedContexts</a>, each with its own data model. In
  analytics terms, you need each analytics user to use a model that
  makes sense for the analysis they are doing. By shifting to storing
  raw data only, this firmly puts the responsibility on the data
  analyst.</p>

<p>Another source of problems for data warehouse initiatives is
  ensuring data quality. Trying to get an authoritative single source
  for data requires lots of analysis of how the data is acquired and
  used by different systems. System A may be good for some data, and
  system B for another. You run into rules where system A is better
  for more recent orders but system B is better for orders of a month
  or more ago, unless returns are involved. On top of this, data
  quality is often a subjective issue, different analysis has
  different tolerances for data quality issues, or even a different
  notion of what is good quality.</p>

<p>This leads to a common criticism of the data lake - that it's just a
  dumping ground for data of widely varying quality, better named a
  data swamp. The criticism is both valid and irrelevant. The hot
  title of the New Analytics is "Data Scientist". Although it's a
  much-abused title, many of these folks do have a solid background in
  science. And any serious scientist knows all about data quality
  problems. Consider what you might think is the simple matter of analyzing temperature readings
  over time. You have to take into account that some weather stations
  are relocated in ways that may subtly affect the readings, anomalies due to problems
  in equipment, missing periods when the sensors aren't working. Many
  of the sophisticated statistical techniques out there are created
  to sort out data quality problems. Scientists are always skeptical about
  data quality and are used to dealing with questionable data. So for
  them the lake is important because they get to work with raw data
  and can be deliberate about applying techniques to make sense of it,
  rather than some opaque data cleansing mechanism that probably does
  more harm that good.</p>

<p>Data warehouses usually would not just cleanse but also aggregate
  the data into a form that made it easier to analyze. But scientists
  tend to object to this too, because aggregation implies throwing
  away data. The data lake should contain all the data because you
  don't know what people will find valuable, either today or in a
  couple of years time. </p>

<p>One of my colleagues illustrated this thinking with a recent
  example:

  "We were trying to compare our automated predictive models versus
  manual forecasts made by the company's contract managers. To do this
  we decided to train our models on year old data and compare our
  predictions to the ones made by managers at that time. Since we now
  know the correct results, this should be a fair test of accuracy.
  When we started to do this, it appeared that the manager's
  predictions were horrible and that even our simple models, made in
  just two weeks, were crushing them. We suspected that this
  out-performance was too good to be true. After a lot of testing and
  digging we discovered that the time stamps associated with those
  manager predictions were incorrect. They were being modified by some
  end-of-month processing report. So in short, these values in the
  data warehouse were useless; we feared that we would have no way of
  performing this comparison. After more digging we found that these
  reports had been stored and so we could extract the real forecasts
  made at that time. (We're crushing them again but it's taken many
  months to get there)."
  
</p>

<p>The complexity of this raw data means that there is room for
  something that curates the data into a more manageable structure (as
  well as reducing the considerable volume of data.) The data lake shouldn't be
  accessed directly very much. Because the data is raw, you need a lot
  of skill to make any sense of it. You have relatively few people who
  work in the data lake, as they uncover generally useful views of
  data in the lake, they can create a number of data marts each of which
  has a specific model for a single bounded context. A larger number
  of downstream users can then treat these lakeshore marts as an
  authoritative source for that context. </p>

<img src="images/dataLake/context.png" width="600px">
<p><i></i></p>
<p>So far I've described the data lake as singular point for
  integrating data across an enterprise, but I should mention that
  isn't how it was originally intended. The term <a href="https://jamesdixon.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/pentaho-hadoop-and-data-lakes/">was
  coined by James Dixon in 2010</a>, when he did that he intended a
  data lake to be used for a single data source, multiple data sources
  would instead form a "water garden". Despite its original formulation
  the prevalent usage now is to treat a data lake as combining many
  sources. <a href="#footnote-usage">[2]</a></p>

<p>You should use a data lake for analytic purposes, not for
  collaboration between operational systems. When operational systems
  collaborate they should do this through services designed for the
  purpose, such as RESTful HTTP calls, or asynchronous messaging. The
  lake is too complex to trawl for operational communication. It may
  be that analysis of the lake can lead to new operational
  communication routes, but these should be built directly rather than
  through the lake.</p>

<p>It is important that all data put in the lake should have a clear
  provenance in place and time. Every data item should have a clear
  trace to what system it came from and when the data was produced.
  The data lake thus contains a historical record. This might come
  from feeding <a href="/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html">Domain Events</a>
  into the lake, a natural fit with <a href="/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourced</a> systems. But it could
  also come from systems doing a regular dump of current state into the
  lake - an approach that's valuable when the source system doesn't
  have any temporal capabilities but you want a temporal
  analysis of its data. A consequence of this is that data put into
  the lake is immutable, an observation once stated cannot be removed
  (although it may be refuted later), you should also expect
  <a href="ContradictoryObservations.html">ContradictoryObservations</a>.</p>

<p>The data lake is schemaless, it's up to the source systems to
  decide what schema to use and for consumers to work out how to deal
  with the resulting chaos. Furthermore the source
  systems are free to change their inflow data schemas at will, and
  again the consumers have to cope. Obviously we prefer such changes
  to be as minimally disruptive as possible, but scientists prefer messy
  data to losing data.</p>

<p>Data lakes are going to be very large, and much of the storage is
  oriented around the notion of a large schemaless structure - which
  is why Hadoop and HDFS are usually the technologies people use for
  data lakes. One of the vital tasks of the lakeshore marts is to
  reduce the amount of data you need to deal with, so that big data analytics
  doesn't have to deal with large amounts of data.</p>

<p>The Data Lake's appetite for a deluge of raw data raises awkward
  questions about privacy and security. The principle of
  <a href="Datensparsamkeit.html">Datensparsamkeit</a> is very much in tension with the data
  scientists' desire to capture all data now. A data lake makes a
  tempting target for crackers, who might love to siphon choice bits
  into the public oceans. Restricting direct lake access to a small
  data science group may reduce this threat, but doesn't avoid the
  question of how that group is kept accountable for the privacy of
  the data they sail on. </p>
