<p>Kent Beck came up with his four rules of simple design while he
  was developing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> in the late 1990's. I express
  them like this. <a href="#footnote-xp-formulation">[1]</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Passes the tests</li>

<li>Reveals intention</li>

<li>No duplication</li>

<li>Fewest elements</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules are in priority order, so "passes the tests" takes
  priority over "reveals intention"</p>

<img src="images/beckDesignRules/kent.jpg" width="200px">
<p><i>
    Kent Beck developed Extreme Programming, Test Driven Development,
    and can always be relied on for good Victorian facial hair for his
    local ballet.
  </i></p>
<p>The most important of the rules is "passes the tests". XP was
  revolutionary in how it raised testing to a first-class activity in
  software development, so it's natural that testing should play a
  prominent role in these rules. The point is that whatever else you
  do with the software, the primary aim is that it works as
  intended and tests are there to ensure that happens.</p>

<p>"Reveals intention" is Kent's way of saying the code
  should be easy to understand. Communication is a core value of
  Extreme Programing, and many programmers like to stress that
  programs are there to be read by people. Kent's form of expressing
  this rule implies that the key to enabling understanding is to express your
  intention in the code, so that your readers can understand what your
  purpose was when writing it.</p>

<p>The "no duplication" is perhaps the most powerfully subtle of
  these rules. It's a notion expressed elsewhere as DRY or SPOT <a href="#footnote-dry">[2]</a>, Kent
  expressed it as saying everything should be said "Once and only Once."
  Many programmers have observed that the exercise of eliminating
  duplication is a powerful way to drive out good designs. <a href="#footnote-dup-column">[3]</a></p>

<p>The last rule tells us that anything that doesn't serve the three
  prior rules should be removed. At the time these rules were
  formulated there was a lot of design advice around adding elements to
  an architecture in order to increase flexibility for future requirements.
  Ironically the extra complexity of all of these elements usually
  made the system harder to modify and thus less flexible in practice.</p>

<p>People often find there is some tension between "no duplication"
  and "reveals intention", leading to arguments about which order
  those rules should appear. I've always seen their order as
  unimportant, since they feed off each other in refining the code. Such things
  as adding duplication to increase clarity is often papering over a problem,
  when it would be better to solve it. <a href="#footnote-kent-empathy">[4]</a></p>

<img src="images/beckDesignRules/sketch.png" width="500px">
<p><i></i></p>
<p>What I like about these rules is that they are very simple to
  remember, yet following them improves code in any language or
  programming paradigm that I've worked with. They are an example of
  Kent's skill in finding principles that are generally applicable and
  yet concrete enough to shape my actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the time there was a lot of &#8220;design is subjective&#8221;, &#8220;design is
  a matter of taste&#8221; bullshit going around. I disagreed. There are
  better and worse designs. These criteria aren&#8217;t perfect, but they
  serve to sort out some of the obvious crap and (importantly) you can
  evaluate them right now. The real criteria for quality of design,
  &#8220;minimizes cost (including the cost of delay) and maximizes benefit
  over the lifetime of the software,&#8221; can only be evaluated post hoc,
  and even then any evaluation will be subject to a large bag full of
  cognitive biases. The four rules are generally predictive.</p>

<p>There are many expressions of these rules out there, here are a
    few that I think are worth exploring:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design">J.B.
      Rainsberger's summary</a>. He also has a good discussion of <a href="http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/2013/12/07/putting-an-age-old-battle-to-rest/">the
      interplay between the rules 2&amp;3.</a></li>

<li><a href="http://xprogramming.com/classics/expemergentdesign/">Ron Jeffries</a></li>

<li>These rules, like much else of Extreme Programming, were
      originally discussed and refined <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules">on Ward's Wiki</a>.</li>
