However (and this is fascinating in its own right) that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that we can&amp;#8217;t measure the impact of DevOps, or how good people are at doing it. The proof of this, and also of the startling impact of the DevOps movement, is now available in the form of the 2014 State of DevOps report (which you can &lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/2014-devops-report"&gt;download for free&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, a collaboration between &lt;a href="http://nicolefv.com/"&gt;Nicole Forsgren Velasquez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim"&gt;Gene Kim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble"&gt;yours truly&lt;/a&gt;, surveyed over 9,200 people worldwide, covering a wide range of industries and types of organization. Our goal for the report was ambitious. We set out to measure IT performance, business performance, the impact of particular practices (such as continuous integration, test automation, and version control), and also culture, and then to discover to what extent they influenced each other. How, you might ask, do you measure these things like culture and organizational performance? Following Douglas Hubbard&amp;#8217;s definition of measurement as &amp;#8220;A quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations,&amp;#8221; it turns out that you can &lt;a href="www.amazon.com/dp/B003MXI78Y?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;measure anything&lt;/a&gt; if you put your mind to it. The report describes both our methodology and the way we measured these apparent intangibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed we not only measured these things: we have sound, statistically significant data that shows that culture and DevOps practices impact both IT performance and organizational performance. In direct contradiction to a popular narrative of the last ten years, IT matters &amp;#8212; indeed, the results show it is a competitive advantage &amp;#8212; and DevOps culture and practices are instrumental in achieving both high IT performance and organizational performance. Readers of this blog will be especially interested to learn that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trunk-based development, continuous integration, and automated testing measurably improve both IT performance and organizational performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a high-trust culture has a strong impact on both IT performance and organizational performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using external change approval processes such as a change advisory board, as opposed to peer-based code review techniques, significantly impacts throughput while doing almost nothing to improve stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job satisfaction is the biggest predictor of organizational performance, and using DevOps practices are good predictors of job satisfaction.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very excited by the report. We improved on &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/2013-state-of-devops-infographic"&gt;last year&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; method for measuring IT performance. We showed how you can measure culture and organizational performance. Most important, the analysis of our enormous data set demonstrates definitively that the strategies championed by the DevOps movement work, and that they provide a competitive advantage to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to my collaborators, the fabulous team at PuppetLabs, and to all of you who took the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, we both had the privilege of working with Puppet Labs to develop the 2012 DevOps Survey Of Practice. It was especially exciting for Gene, because we were able to benchmark the performance of over 4000 IT organizations, and to gain an understanding what behaviors result in their incredible performance. This continues research that he has been doing of high performing IT organizations that started for him in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, Gene Kim and I will discuss the research hypotheses that we&amp;#8217;re setting out to test in the 2013 DevOps Survey Of Practice, explain the mechanics of how these types of cross-population studies actually work (so you help this research effort or even start your own), then describe the key findings that came out of the 2012 study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first off, if you&amp;#8217;re even remotely interested in DevOps, &lt;a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1483785/DevOps-Survey-2013"&gt;go take the 2013 Puppet Labs DevOps Survey here&lt;/a&gt;! The survey closes on January 15, 2014, so hurry! It only takes about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2013-devops-survey-research-goals"&gt;2013 DevOps Survey Research Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;#8217;s study (which we&amp;#8217;ll describe in more detail below) found that high performing organizations that were employing DevOps practices were massively outperforming their peers: they were doing 30x more frequent code deploys, and had deployment lead times measured in minutes or hours (versus lower performers, who required weeks, months or quarters to complete their deployments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high performers also had far better deployment outcomes: their changes and deployments had twice the change success rates, and when the changes failed, they could restore service 12x faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the 2013 study is to gain a better understanding of exactly what practices are required to achieve this high performance. Our hypothesis is that the following are required, and we&amp;#8217;ll be looking to independently evaluate the effect of each of these practices on performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small teams with high trust that span the entire value stream: Dev, QA, IT Operations and Infosec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared goals and shared pain that span the entire value stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small development batch sizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presence of continuous, automated integration and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasis on creating a culture of learning, experimentation and innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emphasis on creating resilient systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also testing two other hypotheses that one of us (Gene) is especially excited about, because it&amp;#8217;s something he&amp;#8217;s wanted to do ever since 1999!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead time&lt;/strong&gt;: In plant manufacturing, lead time is the time required to turn raw materials into finished goods. There is a deeply held belief in the Lean community that lead time is the single best predictor of quality, customer satisfaction and employee happiness. We are testing this hypothesis for the DevOps value stream in the 2013 survey instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Last year, we confirmed that DevOps practices correlate with substantially improved IT performance (e.g., deploy frequencies, lead times, change success rates, MTTR). This year, we will be testing whether improved IT performance correlates with improved business performance. In this year&amp;#8217;s study, we&amp;#8217;ve added inserted three questions that are known to correlate with organizational performance, which is known to correlate with business performance (e.g., competitiveness in the marketplace, return on assets, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dream headline would be, &amp;#8220;high performing organizations not only do 30x more frequent code deployments than their peers, but they also outperform the S&amp;amp;P 500 by 3x as measured by shareholder return and return on assets.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are many other variables that contribute to business performance besides Dev and Ops performance (e.g., profitability, market segment, market share, etc.). However, in our minds, the reliance upon IT performance is obvious: as Chris Little said, &amp;#8220;Every organization is an IT business, regardless of what business they think they&amp;#8217;re in.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When IT does poorly, the business will do poorly. And when IT helps the organization win, those organizations will out-perform their competitors in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This hypothesis forms the basis of the hedge fund that Erik wants to create in the last chapter of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Phoenix-Project-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO/"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, where they would make long or short bets, based on the known operating characteristics of the IT organization.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-theory-behind-cross-population-studies-and-survey-instruments"&gt;The Theory Behind Cross-Population Studies and Survey Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like last year, this year&amp;#8217;s DevOps survey is a cross-population study, designed to explore the link between organizational performance and organizational practices and cultural norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a cross-population study? It&amp;#8217;s a statistical research technique designed to uncover what factors (e.g., practices, cultural norms, etc.) correlate with outcomes (e.g., IT performance). Cross-population studies are often used in medical research to answer questions like, &amp;#8220;is cigarette smoking a significant factor in early mortality?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly designed cross-population studies are considered a much more rigorous approach of testing efficacy of what practices work than say, interviewing people about what they think worked, ROI stories from vendors, or collecting &amp;#8220;known, best practices.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/6464?token=JXI7N7uDAMybn5lduEANKdQhwmXNNkJoBYsb2fE4jeFS9KsliXjnALaa33oHlCOP0_nW8tviUZ8zYBdwzPIOPtQ" width="426" height="289"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When doing survey design, we might state our hypotheses in the following form: &amp;#8220;we believe that IT organizations which have high trust have higher IT performance.&amp;#8221; In other words, the higher the trust levels in the IT organization, the higher the performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then put this question in the survey instrument, and then analyze the results. If we were to plot the results on a graph, we would put the dependent variable (i.e., performance) on the Y-axis, and the independent variable (i.e., presence of high trust) on the X-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would then test to see if there is a correlation between the two. Shown below is an example of what it looks like when the two variables have low or no correlation, and one that has a significant positive correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/6465?token=EVRyxLU4nXU9O19I5TKk_64PCVLbwzGFy9P3kEQKdMUo4Ceg6Yn-cC5jFw2_N9IQwEPkrSUBLmUA_cJKWm5YP3g" width="463" height="162"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to find a significant correlation, such as displayed on the right, we could then assert that &amp;#8220;the higher your organization&amp;#8217;s trust levels, in general, the higher your IT performance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Graph adapted from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence"&gt;Wikipedia entry on Correlation and Dependence&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="key-2012-devops-survey-findings"&gt;The 2012 DevOps Survey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will describe the the key findings that came out of the 2012 DevOps Survey, as well as a brief discussion of the research hypotheses that went into the survey design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the DevOps community, we have long asserted that certain practices enables organizations simultaneously deliver fast flow of features to market, while providing world-class stability, reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed the survey to validate this, and tested a series of technical practices to determine which of them correlated with high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey ran for 30 days, and we had 4,039 completed respondents. (This is an astonishingly high number, by the way. When Kurt Milne and Gene Kim did similar studies in 2006, each study typically required $200K to do the survey design, gather responses from a couple hundred people, and then perform survey analysis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/2013-velocity-devops-metrics-its-not-just-for-webops-any-more"&gt;slides that Gene Kim, Jez Humble and James Turnbull presented at the 2013 Velocity Conference here&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://puppetlabs.com/2013-state-of-devops-infographic"&gt;full Puppet Labs infographics and results here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first surprise was how much the high performing organizations were outperforming their non-high-performing peers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agility metrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;30x more frequent code deployments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;8,000x faster lead time than their peers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliability metrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2x the change success rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12x faster MTTR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, they were more agile: they were deploying code 30x more frequently, and the lead time required to go from &amp;#8220;code committed&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;successfully running in production&amp;#8221; was completed 8,000x faster &amp;#8212; high performers had lead times measured in minutes or hours, while lower performers had lead times measured in weeks, months or even quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were the high performers doing more work, but they had far better outcomes: when the high performers deployed changes and code, they were twice as likely to be completed successfully (i.e., without causing a production outage or service impairment), and when the change failed and resulted in an incident, the time required to resolve the incident was 12x faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were astonished and delighted with this finding, as it showed not only that it was possible to break the core, chronic conflict, but that it seemed to confirm that just as in manufacturing, agility and reliability go hand in hand. In other words, lead time correlates with both both agility and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Gene will write more on his personal interpretations of the 2012 DevOps Survey Of Practice in a future post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this gives you a good idea of why we&amp;#8217;ve worked so hard on the 2012 and 2013 DevOps Survey, as well as how to conduct your own cross-population studies. Please let us know if you have any questions or if there&amp;#8217;s anything we can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, help us understand what in DevOps and Continuous Delivery work by &lt;a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1483785/DevOps-Survey-2013"&gt;taking 10 minutes to participate in the 2013 Puppet Labs DevOps Survey here by January 15, 2014&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the program committee was to create a conference that represents our industry as we want it to look, not as it is right now. That&amp;#8217;s an ambitious goal that involves changing the way we think about everything from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc587c76Syg"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PijCUJDb_hc"&gt;governance&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JF_QMIMBls"&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFcux5UO4A"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Socg4SIzAB4"&gt;design&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jmZkV23TEs"&gt;IT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7779Wrun5fo"&gt;operations&lt;/a&gt;. Not only did our speakers cover all these topics; they also provided real examples of how these changes, along with the cultural changes necessary to support them, have been achieved at enterprise scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we attacked one of the main objections we hear time and time again &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;that sounds great, but it couldn&amp;#8217;t work here&amp;#8221;. Part of our vision was to provide a platform for people to speak about gnarly, real-life examples that demonstrate that, with sufficient hard work and ingenuity, ideas like continuous delivery, devops, and lean product development can provide significant competitive advantage through higher quality, cost savings, and happier customers, even in traditionally slow-moving and highly-regulated industries with large, complex, heterogeneous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two talks that I am particularly happy to have on record are &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trqjj3d3lhQ"&gt;Gary Gruver&amp;#8217;s talk&lt;/a&gt; on doing continuous delivery for printer firmware at HP, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS97X5ZTGc"&gt;John Kordyback&amp;#8217;s talk&lt;/a&gt; on doing continuous delivery with mainframes in the financial services industry. Alternatively, if you want a vision of the state of the art of continuous delivery, it would be hard to beat &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyWI3gLpB8o"&gt;Adrian Cockcroft&amp;#8217;s opening keynote&lt;/a&gt; (the most highly rated talk of the conference) on how Netflix approach building and running systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, both the individual quality of the talks and the vision they present in concert was incredibly inspiring. Gene Kim comments, &amp;#8220;The FlowCon program was amazing. In my mind, what was presented at FlowCon is what every IT practitioner will be required to know in 10 years time.&amp;#8221; Thank you again to all of our speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data on Gender Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of representing the industry as we want it to look is changing its composition. Thus another personal goal for me was to gather data to support my hypothesis that &lt;a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/09/how-we-got-40-female-speakers-at-flowcon/"&gt;taking steps to increase diversity&lt;/a&gt; at conferences doesn&amp;#8217;t mean reducing quality. FlowCon, like the excellent &lt;a href="http://gotocon.com/"&gt;GOTO conferences&lt;/a&gt; that Trifork produces, records feedback from participants. Everybody leaving a session can give feedback on whether they thought the talk was good, mediocre or poor by tapping a red, amber or green rectangle on an iPhone on their way out. We then calculate overall satisfaction as follows: satisfaction = (green votes) / (total votes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back all the data, the first thing I did is look at the average (mean) satisfaction for male speakers versus female speakers. It turns out that in both cases the average is between 71% and 72%. First of all, this demonstrates that there was no statistically significant difference in satisfaction between male and female speakers. This is important because it means our steps to increase diversity &amp;#8212; including reaching out to a wide network to ensure that 50% of our invited speakers were women &amp;#8212; didn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;lower the bar&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a deeper implication: any claim that the all-white-male conference programs that are so depressingly common in the tech industry are the result of some meritocratic process is BS. They are, rather, the result of not putting in enough effort to seek out high quality speakers from &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst.html"&gt;historically discriminated against&lt;/a&gt; groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our industry were truly meritocratic, the speaker line-up and attendees would resemble the wider population, because we know that there is &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DiversityImbalance.html"&gt;no biological explanation&lt;/a&gt; for the overwhelming proportion of white dudes in our industry. So let&amp;#8217;s not fool ourselves any more with claims that taking steps to improve diversity is &amp;#8220;reverse discrimination&amp;#8221;. Any time we don&amp;#8217;t take concrete, systematic steps forward we are silently complicit in perpetuating the status quo &amp;#8212; which is why it&amp;#8217;s not good enough when leaders in the tech community ignore the problem. If you ignore the problem, you&amp;#8217;re part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to emphasize that what the program committee achieved was not very hard, once we spent some time thinking the problem through, and also that it was insufficient. We had a reasonable level of gender diversity, but the speakers were still overwhelmingly white. I don&amp;#8217;t have data for the diversity of our audience, but based on observation, there were more white guys than I would see if I walked out of the door onto the streets (and this is in San Francisco, which is far from being representative of the wider population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to educate yourself further on these issues, I suggest watching &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VafA2stfTUM"&gt;Ashe Dryden&amp;#8217;s talk&lt;/a&gt; on programming diversity. And if you&amp;#8217;d like to become more effective at creating change, check out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJWKvkfbPo0"&gt;Linda Rising&amp;#8217;s closing keynote&lt;/a&gt;.

However the shameful RubyConf &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/status/380179040545406976"&gt;&amp;#8220;binders full of men&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; debacle and the Neanderthal level of discussion around it has wound me up enough to write this account somewhat prematurely. So here is how we achieved &amp;gt;40% female representation on our &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speakers/"&gt;speaker roster&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/"&gt;FlowCon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 0. Care About The Outcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When John Esser approached me to put together a conference about continuous delivery, devops and lean product development, I thought carefully about it. I&amp;#8217;ve helped put together a conference program before (&lt;a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2012/sf2012/"&gt;QCon SF 2012&lt;/a&gt;), and that was pretty hard work, so I wanted to be sure I had the correct motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I have always disliked about tech conferences is being surrounded by a bunch of other straight white guys (nothing personal, some of my best friends are straight white guys). It&amp;#8217;s a constant reminder of the fact that, due to a number of socioeconomic factors, &lt;a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/"&gt;straight white guys have it easier than others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put together a conference which reflects my community as I would like it to look, not as it actually looks. So one of the &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/"&gt;four values&lt;/a&gt; the FlowCon program committee came up with was this: &amp;#8220;Diversity: We believe the technology community &amp;#8211; and thus the conference speakers and participants &amp;#8211; should reflect the demographics of our customers and the wider world.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for this. Firstly, we can&amp;#8217;t effectively change the world through technology without diversity. To find out why, come and see &lt;a href="http://ashedryden.com/"&gt;Ashe Dryden&lt;/a&gt; talk about how &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/presentation/Programming%20Diversity"&gt;&amp;#8220;diverse communities and workplaces create better products&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. Second, one of the main reasons I like working at &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; is that one of &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us"&gt;the three pillars of our mission&lt;/a&gt; is to &amp;#8220;advocate passionately for social and economic justice.&amp;#8221; The fact there are so few women in IT reflects social and economic injustice inherent in our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sure you actually have a mission for your conference is something I learned from helping out with &lt;a href="qconsf.com"&gt;QCon SF&lt;/a&gt;. It is a constant reminder of why you&amp;#8217;re doing it and what&amp;#8217;s important about it. If you don&amp;#8217;t have a mission, you&amp;#8217;re at the mercy of the implicit biases of the organizers. As RubyConf shows, you can&amp;#8217;t just throw in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shanley/status/380186471174393856"&gt;&amp;#8220;one weird trick&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; of anonymous submissions and expect that it will somehow solve the problem. Everybody on the program committee actually has to care about the outcome, or they won&amp;#8217;t put in the right amount of work to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you do that, the rest of the steps aren&amp;#8217;t that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1. Make Sure Your Program Committee Is Aligned With Your Mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had an idea about the mission of the conference, I reached out to some people whom I thought would share it. I was lucky enough that &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Elisabeth+Hendrickson"&gt;Elizabeth Hendrickson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Lane+Halley"&gt;Lane Halley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Gene+Kim"&gt;Gene Kim&lt;/a&gt; agreed to join &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/John+Esser"&gt;John Esser&lt;/a&gt; and me on the program committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons I asked those particular people, apart from being extremely competent and well-respected in their field, was another conference goal: &amp;#8220;Spanning boundaries: We believe that the best products are created collaboratively by people with a range of skills and experiences.&amp;#8221; The program committee has representation from the UX, testing, operations, product development and programming communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2. Make Sure Your Invited Speakers Are Aligned With Your Mission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the decision to have about half the program be invited speakers. Part of that was about ensuring that we had a solid core program. But it was also a chance for us to put our mission into practice, so that when we put out the call for proposals we had a bunch of confirmed speakers who demonstrated we were serious about our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we made sure that the invited speakers were respected boundary spanners, and that 50% of them were women. This involved more work than we would have had to put in had we just invited our friends (a popular strategy for program committees). It was also telling that we got more refusals from women than we got from men due to schedule conflicts. The main factor here was that female speakers are actually in greater demand than men because there are relatively fewer of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3. The Anonymous Call For Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you jump straight to step 3, it&amp;#8217;s likely you will suffer the fate of RubyConf and fail. If you use this as your only strategy for increasing representation it won&amp;#8217;t work. This strategy has been &lt;a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2012/05/21/how-i-got-50-women-speakers-at-my-tech-conference/"&gt;thoroughly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2012/11/solving-pipeline-problem.html"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; who have used this approach as part of increasing diversity at their conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a form in Google Docs for people to propose talks. They had to enter their email address, but we mentioned in the form that they should use one that didn&amp;#8217;t identify them if they wanted their proposal to be more anonymous. Of the 82 people who submitted a talk proposal, 18 (21%) were women as far as we can work out (once the program was confirmed I used &lt;a href="http://rapportive.com/"&gt;Rapportive&lt;/a&gt; to reverse-engineer email addresses based on publicly available information). Ultimately, three of the eight people who made it into the final program based on submitted proposals were women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low female representation through the CFP is the reason our program isn&amp;#8217;t 50% female. Even getting the 21% of submissions that we did involved reaching out through mailing lists, Twitter, and our networks to encourage women to submit. This step, along with making it clear that you actually care, is essential if you in fact expect women to submit through the anonymous CFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four steps resulted in &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speakers/"&gt;10 of our 24 speakers being women&lt;/a&gt;. I have three main observations coming out of this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/blog/my-daughters-high-school-programming-teacher"&gt;increasing the number of women who take programming classes in school&lt;/a&gt; or enter the IT industry and don&amp;#8217;t immediately quit in horror, creating a conference with reasonable female representation is not actually a hard problem. Yes, we put in more work to achieve this goal than we would have had we not cared. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t significantly more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conference organizers who claim to care but fail to achieve good representation should quit whining and take real steps to achieve this goal. The community should hold them to higher standards. If the conference speakers are a bunch of straight white guys, the only reason is that the organizers didn&amp;#8217;t care enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, in the wake of RubyConf, I have been angered but unsurprised to observe the usual chorus about how increasing representation somehow means lowering standards. Not only is this incredibly insulting to the many extraordinary women working in our industry, but it is just false. I dare anyone to look at &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/schedule/index.jsp"&gt;the kick-ass program&lt;/a&gt; we have put together for FlowCon and try and claim that we have somehow lowered standards to achieve great a barely acceptable level of representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing you will hear is that it is harder to find female speakers on &amp;#8220;hard&amp;#8221; topics such as programming than for &amp;#8220;soft&amp;#8221; ones. I find this claim baffling because in my experience changing organizational culture (considered a &amp;#8220;soft&amp;#8221; topic) is, in my experience, way way harder than knocking out lines of code (even well-factored unit-tested ones). But you&amp;#8217;ll see on our program that women are covering the whole gamut from &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/presentation/Organizational%20Change%20Myths%20and%20Patterns%20for%20Evangelists"&gt;organizational change&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/presentation/Therapeutic%20Refactoring"&gt;refactoring&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/presentation/Configuration%20Management:%20Stability%20in%20Your%20Pipeline"&gt;configuration management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it&amp;#8217;s not all good news. In particular, we have only one non-white speaker. I&amp;#8217;ll hold my hand up on this &amp;#8211; we didn&amp;#8217;t explicitly set non-white representation as a goal within the program committee, and by the time it became obvious it was a problem (Step 3) it was too late to do anything. This demonstrates why steps 0-2 are important. If we run FlowCon again, we will do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/schedule/index.jsp"&gt;check out the program&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://secure.trifork.com/flowcon-sanfran-2013/registration/registration.jsp?promotionCode=humb50"&gt;follow this link&lt;/a&gt; to register with a 10% discount. If you need more than a one day conference to come to San Francisco, &lt;a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/balancedteam/"&gt;Balanced Team are running their conference&lt;/a&gt; the following two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another popular &lt;a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Silencing"&gt;silencing tactic&lt;/a&gt; in this discussion is that bringing attention to the level of diversity in a conference is in itself a form of sexism or racism. There&amp;#8217;s a cartoon on the left which expresses nicely why this is in fact horribly misguided (or you could check out &lt;a href="http://www.sociologyinfocus.com/2012/01/30/im-not-racist-im-colorblind/"&gt;one of the many excellent articles on &amp;#8220;colourblindness&amp;#8221; and racism&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the Geek Feminism &lt;a href="http://geekfeminism.org/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for tons of useful information and advice on making things better for women in tech. Also check out the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen"&gt;@CallbackWomen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevChix"&gt;@DevChix&lt;/a&gt; Twitter accounts to spread the word for your CFP. Ashe Dryden also wrote &lt;a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/increasing-diversity-at-your-conference"&gt;an excellent post&lt;/a&gt; on creating more diverse conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor when designing a woman-friendly conference is to create an &lt;a href="http://gotocon.com/flowcon-sanfran-2013/anti-harassment-policy/"&gt;anti-harassment&lt;/a&gt; policy. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/on-sexual-harassment-at-conventions-elise-matheson-speaks-out/"&gt;this account&lt;/a&gt; of a woman who actually needed to use the anti-harassment policy (trigger alert).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, this entry is now starting to receive the attention of anonymous trolls. I&amp;#8217;ve left the first one as an example of the idiocy that passes for dialogue in this debate (and from supposedly smart people at that). But forthwith I&amp;#8217;ll be deleting anonymous or otherwise uncivil posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the concepts that will feature in the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449368425?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;new book I am working on&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;#8220;risk management theatre&amp;#8221;. This is the name I coined for the commonly-encountered control apparatus, imposed in a top-down way, which makes life painful for the innocent but can be circumvented by the guilty (the name comes by analogy with &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/12/tsa-insanity-201112"&gt;security theatre&lt;/a&gt;.) Risk management theatre is the outcome of optimizing processes for the case that somebody will do something stupid or bad, because (to quote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470405163?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;Bjarte Bogsnes talking about management&lt;/a&gt;), &amp;#8220;there might be someone who who cannot be trusted. The strategy seems to be preventative control on everybody instead of damage control on those few.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately risk management theatre is everywhere in large organizations, and reflects the continuing dominance of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y"&gt;Theory X&lt;/a&gt; management paradigm. The alternative to the top-down control approach is what I have called adaptive risk management, informed by human-centred management theories (for example the work of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071808019?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;Ohno&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.deming.org/theman/theories/fourteenpoints"&gt;Deming&lt;/a&gt;, Drucker, &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/06/28/the-financial-times-flubs-the-management-revolution/"&gt;Denning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://onedublin.org/2012/06/19/stanford-universitys-carol-dweck-on-the-growth-mindset-and-education/"&gt;Dweck&lt;/a&gt;) and the study of how complex systems behave, particularly when they &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1409422216?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;drift into failure&lt;/a&gt;. Adaptive risk management is based on systems thinking, transparency, experimentation, and fast feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of the differences between the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive risk management&lt;/strong&gt; (people work to detect problems through improving transparency and feedback, and solve them through improvisation and experimentation)
&lt;strong&gt;Risk management theatre&lt;/strong&gt; (management imposes controls and processes which make life painful for the innocent but can be circumvented by the guilty)


&lt;strong&gt;Continuous code review&lt;/strong&gt; in which engineers ask a colleague to look over their changes before check-in, technical leads review all check-ins made by their team, and code review tools allow people to comment on each others&amp;#8217; work once it is in trunk.
&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory code review&lt;/strong&gt; enforced by check-in gates where a tool requires changes to be signed off by somebody else before they can be merged into trunk. This is inefficient and delays feedback on non-trivial regressions (including performance regressions).


&lt;strong&gt;Fast, automated unit and acceptance tests&lt;/strong&gt; which inform engineers within minutes (for unit tests) or tens of minutes (for acceptance tests) if they have introduced a known regression into trunk, and which can be run on workstations before commit.
&lt;strong&gt;Manual testing&lt;/strong&gt; as a precondition for integration, especially when performed by a different team or in a different location. Like mandatory code review, this delays feedback on the effect of the change on the system as a whole.


&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1621865"&gt;deployment pipeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which provides complete traceability of all changes from check-in to release, and which detects and rejects risky changes automatically through a combination of automated tests and manual validations.
&lt;strong&gt;A comprehensive documentation trail&lt;/strong&gt; so that in the event of a failure we can discover the human error that is the root cause of failures in the mechanistic, Cartesian paradigm that applies in the domain of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin"&gt;systems that are not complex&lt;/a&gt;.


&lt;strong&gt;Situational awareness&lt;/strong&gt; created through tools which make it easy to monitor, analyze and correlate relevant data. This includes process, business and systems level metrics as well as the discussion threads around events.
&lt;strong&gt;Segregation of duties&lt;/strong&gt; which acts as a barrier to knowledge sharing, feedback and collaboration, and reduces the situational awareness which is essential to an effective response in the event of an incident.


&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to emphasize that there are circumstances in which the countermeasures on the right are appropriate. If your delivery and operational processes are chaotic and undisciplined, imposing controls can be an effective way to improve &amp;#8211; so long as we understand they are a temporary countermeasure rather than an end in themselves, and provided they are applied with the consent of the people who must work within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some differences between the two approaches in the field of IT:&lt;/p&gt;


Adaptive risk management (people work to detect problems through improving transparency and feedback, and solve them through improvisation and experimentation)
Risk management theatre (management imposes controls and processes which make life painful for the innocent but can be circumvented by the guilty)


&lt;strong&gt;Principle-based and dynamic:&lt;/strong&gt; principles can be applied to situations that were not envisaged when the principles were created.
&lt;strong&gt;Rule-based and static&lt;/strong&gt;: when we encounter new technologies and processes (for example, cloud computing) we need to rewrite the rules.


&lt;strong&gt;Uses transparency to prevent accidents and bad behaviour.&lt;/strong&gt; When it&amp;#8217;s easy for anybody to see what anybody else is doing, people are more careful. As Louis Brandeis said, &amp;#8220;Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.&amp;#8221;
&lt;strong&gt;Uses controls to prevent accidents and bad behaviour.&lt;/strong&gt; This approach is the default for legislators as a way to prove they have taken action in response to a disaster. But controls limit our ability to adapt quickly to unexpected problems. This introduces a new class of risks, for example over-reliance on emergency change processes because the standard change process is too slow and bureaucratic.


&lt;strong&gt;Accepts that systems drift into failure.&lt;/strong&gt; Our systems and the environment are constantly changing, and there will never be sufficient information to make globally rational decisions. Humans solve our problems and we must rely on them to make judgement calls.
&lt;strong&gt;Assumes humans are the problem.&lt;/strong&gt; If people always follow the processes correctly, nothing bad can happen. Controls are put in place to manage &amp;#8220;bad apples&amp;#8221;. Ignores the fact that process specifications always require interpretation and adaptation in reality.


&lt;strong&gt;Rewards people for collaboration, experimentation, and system-level improvements.&lt;/strong&gt; People collaborate to improve system-level metrics such as lead time and time to restore service. No rewards for &amp;#8220;productivity&amp;#8221; on individual or function level. Accepts that locally rational decisions can lead to system level failures.
&lt;strong&gt;Rewards people based on personal &amp;#8220;productivity&amp;#8221; and local optimization&lt;/strong&gt;. For example operations people optimizing for stability at the expense of throughput, or developers optimizing for velocity at the expense of quality (even though these are false dichotomies.)


&lt;strong&gt;Creates a culture of continuous learning and experimentation&lt;/strong&gt;: People openly discuss mistakes to learn from them and conduct &lt;a href="http://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/"&gt;blameless post-mortems&lt;/a&gt; after outages or customer service problems with the goal of improving the system. People are encouraged to try things out and experiment (with the expectations that many hypotheses will be invalidated) in order to get better.
&lt;strong&gt;Creates a culture of fear and mistrust&lt;/strong&gt;. Encourages finger pointing and lack of ownership for errors, omissions and failure to get things done. As in: If I don&amp;#8217;t do anything unless someone tells me to, I won&amp;#8217;t be held responsible for any resulting failure.


&lt;strong&gt;Failures are a learning opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;. They occur in controlled circumstances, their effects are appropriately mitigated, and they are encouraged as an opportunity to learn how to improve.
&lt;strong&gt;Failures are caused by human error&lt;/strong&gt; (usually a failure to follow some process correctly), and the primary response is to find the person responsible and punish them, and then use further controls and processes as the main strategy to prevent future problems.


&lt;p&gt;Risk management theatre is not just painful and a barrier to the adoption of continuous delivery (and indeed to continuous improvement in general). It is actually dangerous, primarily because it creates a culture of fear and mistrust. As Bogsnes says, &amp;#8220;if the entire management model reeks of mistrust and control mechanisms against unwanted behavior, the result might actually be more, not less, of what we try to prevent. The more people are treated as criminals, the more we risk that they will behave as such.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of organizational culture is a major factor whenever we see people who are scared of losing their jobs, or engage in activities designed to protect themselves in the case that something goes wrong, or attempt to make themselves indispensable through hoarding information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m certainly not suggesting that controls, IT governance frameworks, and oversight are bad in and of themselves. Indeed, applied correctly, they are essential for effective risk management. ITIL for example allows for a &lt;a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/11/continuous-delivery-and-itil-change-management/"&gt;lightweight change management&lt;/a&gt; process that is completely compatible with an adaptive approach to risk management. What&amp;#8217;s decisive is how these framework are implemented. The way such frameworks are used and applied is determined by&amp;#8212;and perpetuates&amp;#8212;&lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/agile-adoption-transformation"&gt;organizational culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the goals of the &lt;a href="http://www.qconferences.com/"&gt;QCon conferences&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;#8220;information Robin Hood&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; finding ways to get out into public the secret sauce of high performing organizations. So I set out to find talks that would answer the questions I frequently get asked: can continuous integration, automated testing, and trunk-based development scale? How does continuous delivery affect the way we do product management? What&amp;#8217;s the business case for continuous delivery? How do you grow a culture that enables it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll find the all these questions answered in the talks below, from the leaders who have been at the forefront of continuous delivery at Amazon, Facebook, Google and Etsy. They also discuss the tools they built and the and practices they use to enable continuous delivery. Finally, you get me talking about how you can adopt continuous delivery at your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to Jesse Robbins, Frank Harris, Nell Thomas, John Penix and Chuck Rossi for these great talks, and to the folks behind &lt;a href="http://qconsf.com/"&gt;QCon SF&lt;/a&gt; for an awesome conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jesserobbins"&gt;Jesse Robbins&lt;/a&gt; ran ops at Amazon before quitting to co-found Opscode (creators of &lt;a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;). He is also co-founder of &lt;a href="velocityconf.com"&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt;. In his copious spare time, he&amp;#8217;s a volunteer firefighter. Basically, Jesse is an enormous over-achiever. This is a fabulous &amp;#8211; and hilarious &amp;#8211; talk that discusses the hardest part of implementing continuous delivery: cultural change. This talk features my favourite devops aphorism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Hacking-Culture"&gt;&lt;img src="http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-25-at-9.15.46-AM.png" alt="Don&amp;#x27;t fight stupid, make more awesome" width="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-967"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;One of the main goals of continuous delivery is to get fast feedback on your &lt;a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/hypothesis-driven-development/229000656"&gt;hypotheses&lt;/a&gt; so you can build the right thing. In this talk &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hirefrank"&gt;Frank Harris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/nellwyn"&gt;Nell Thomas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://codeascraft.com/"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; show off a bunch of their tools, including the A/B testing framework they built for running experiments (which uses &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html"&gt;feature toggles&lt;/a&gt; under the hood). They give an example of an experiment they&amp;#8217;re running right now, and discuss how the ability to gather and analyze data on customer behaviour in real time (see screenshot below) affects the way they do product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Etsy-Deployment"&gt;&lt;img src="http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-25-at-10.31.38-AM.png" alt="Etsy&amp;#x27;ss A/B testing tool, Atlas" width="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-971"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, &lt;a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/author2207.html"&gt;John Penix&lt;/a&gt; of Google shows off the awesome product he and his team built for continuous integration and cloud-based testing at Google. Teams at Google are free to choose their own development practices and toolchain, but this one has a pretty high uptake. When people ask me if trunk-based development and continuous integration can scale, I like to show them the following slide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Continuous-Testing-Build-Cloud"&gt;&lt;img src="http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-25-at-11.15.03-AM.png" alt="CI at scale at Google" width="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-979"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;In addition to discussing the process he uses to release twice a day, Facebook&amp;#8217;s lead release engineer &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/chuckr"&gt;Chuck Rossi&lt;/a&gt; shows off the extensive toolchain they built to deploy at scale. Highlights include Gatekeeper (screenshot below), which manages who gets to see which features as part of their dark launching process, and their deploy tool which categorizes all proposed patches based on the size of the patch, the amount of discussion around it, and the &amp;#8220;push karma&amp;#8221; of the committers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Facebook-Release-Process"&gt;&lt;img src="http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-25-at-11.39.28-AM.png" alt="Gatekeeper" width="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-982"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, Etsy, Google and Facebook are all primarily software development shops which command enormous amounts of resources. They are, to use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BMC_DevOps"&gt;Christopher Little&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; metaphor, unicorns. How can the rest of us adopt continuous delivery? That&amp;#8217;s the subject of my talk, which describes four case studies of organizations that adopted continuous delivery, with varying degrees of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourites &amp;#8211; partly because it&amp;#8217;s embedded software, not a website &amp;#8211; is the story of HP&amp;#8217;s LaserJet Firmware team, who re-architected their software around the principles of continuous delivery. People always want to know the business case for continuous delivery: the FutureSmart team provide one in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321821726?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;the book they wrote&lt;/a&gt; that discusses how they did it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-25-at-11.51.39-AM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://continuousdelivery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2013-05-25-at-11.51.39-AM.png" alt="Economics of continuous delivery" width="400" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-984"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Announcing FlowCon</title><link href="http://www.ciandcd.com/announcing-flowcon.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-22T05:32:42+00:00</updated><author><name>itech001</name></author><id>tag:www.ciandcd.com,2013-05-22:announcing-flowcon.html</id><summary type="html">from:http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/05/announcing-flowcon/&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="post-headline"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Announcing FlowCon&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend quite a lot of time at conferences, and it consistently bothers me that they are so often focused on one particular function: development, testing, UX, systems administration. The point of continuous delivery is to accelerate the rate at which we can learn from each other &amp;#8211; and from our customers. That requires everyone involved in the delivery process (including users, product owners and entrepreneurs) to collaborate throughout. So why isn&amp;#8217;t there a conference which focuses on flow &amp;#8211; the emergent property of great teams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got together with a bunch of like-minded folks &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Elizabeth+Hendrickson"&gt;Elisabeth Hendrickson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Gene+Kim"&gt;Gene Kim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/John+Esser"&gt;John Esser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Lane+Halley"&gt;Lane Halley&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; and now there is a conference about creating flow: &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/"&gt;FlowCon&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s on &lt;strong&gt;Friday November 1 in San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt;, and it&amp;#8217;s produced by &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/"&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.trifork.com/"&gt;Trifork&lt;/a&gt; (creators of the &lt;a href="http://gotocon.com/"&gt;GOTO conferences&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is based around four values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Our goal is to provide the best possible conference forum for practitioners to learn from each other how to build great products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Information&lt;/strong&gt;: We aim to uncover how great products and services are built in real life and make this information freely available to the widest audience possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity&lt;/strong&gt;: We believe the technology community &amp;#8211; and thus the conference speakers and participants &amp;#8211; should reflect the demographics of our customers and the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spanning boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;: We believe that the best products and services are created collaboratively by people with a range of skills and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have put together nearly half of the &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/schedule/index.jsp"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;, and we&amp;#8217;re delighted to announce that &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Adrian+Cockcroft"&gt;Adrian Cockcroft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Catherine+Courage"&gt;Catherine Courage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Jeff+Gothelf"&gt;Jeff Gothelf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/speaker/Linda+Rising"&gt;Linda Rising&lt;/a&gt; will be giving keynotes. &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/schedule/index.jsp"&gt;The program&lt;/a&gt; is still a work in process (a minimum viable product, if you will). In particular, the after lunch sessions are empty &amp;#8211; for a good reason: &lt;strong&gt;we want you to speak in those slots&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re looking for people working to create flow in their organization &amp;#8211; especially those who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Span multiple roles and work across organizational silos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in any of the following areas: a highly regulated environment; a large, traditional enterprise; in the pursuit of social and economic justice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are willing to share obstacles encountered or mistakes made and how you overcame them &amp;#8211; whether cultural or technological.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer actionable advice &amp;#8220;the rest of us&amp;#8221; can apply today (even if we don&amp;#8217;t have the resources of Etsy / Amazon / Google).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your talk could be about culture, technology, design, process &amp;#8211; the only really important criterion is that it draws on what you&amp;#8217;ve learned about helping to create flow in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If that sounds like you, please &lt;a href="http://flowcon.org/flowcon-sanfran-2013/submit"&gt;submit your proposal&lt;/a&gt;. If you know someone who would do a great job, please encourage them to submit. Our submission process is designed to be entirely merit-based, which means that the first round is anonymous. The deadline is midnight Pacific time, Sunday June 23, 2013.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.trifork.com/flowcon-sanfran-2013/registration/"&gt;Tickets for the conference are now on sale&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; at $350 if you register before July 31, or $500 if you register afterwards. Whatever your role or domain, you&amp;#8217;re sure to find inspirational, disruptive thinking that will make you better at creating great products and services. I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ll only bother posting reviews of books that I believe are both excellent and relevant to &lt;a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/"&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;. This book easily satisfies both criteria. Full disclosure: Gene gave me a draft of this book for free for reviewing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably heard of Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford before. They are the three amigos responsible for &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0975568612?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;The Visible Ops Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found in the book pile of every good IT operator. Their new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0988262592?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;The Phoenix Project:  A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win&lt;/a&gt;, follows the format of Eliyahu Goldratt&amp;#8217;s classic, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0884271951?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;The Goal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told from the perspective of newly-minted VP of IT Operations Bill Palmer, it describes the turnaround of failing auto parts company Parts Unlimited. This is to be achieved through the delivery of the eponymous Phoenix Project, a classic &amp;#8220;too big to fail&amp;#8221; software project designed to build a system which will revive the fortunes of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote (p51):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The plot is simple: First, you take an urgent date-driven project, where the shipment date cannot be delayed because of external commitments made to Wall Street or customers. Then you add a bunch of developers who use up all the time in the schedule, leaving no time for testing or operations deployment. And because no one is willing to slip the deployment date, everyone after Development has to take outrageous and unacceptable shortcuts to hit the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are never pretty. Usually, the software product is so unstable and unusable that even the people who were screaming for it end up saying that it&amp;#8217;s not worth shipping. And it&amp;#8217;s always IT Operations who still has to stay up all night, rebooting servers hourly to compensate for crappy code, doing whatever heroics are required to hide from the rest of the world just how bad things really are.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part One of the book describes in loving detail the enormous clusterfuck pie that is baked from these ingredients. The pie is spiced with an internal Sarbanes-Oxley audit which reveals 952 control deficiencies, an outage of the payroll processing system, and various other problems that conspire to deepen the woe of the operations group, all of which are clearly drawn from the deep well of the authors&amp;#8217; real-life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the main characters &amp;#8211; our hero Bill, his boss Steve, and the evil villain Sarah &amp;#8211; The Phoenix Project features a delightful rogues&amp;#8217; gallery which anyone working in an enterprise will recognize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brent Geller, the boy wonder whose encyclopedic knowledge of the company&amp;#8217;s Byzantine IT systems means that his involvement is necessary to get anything done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patty McKee, the Director of Support who runs a change management process so bureaucratic that everybody bypasses it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Pesche, the black binder wielding Chief Information Security Officer whose constant meddling under the guise of improving security has turned him into a pariah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the book details how the IT group is reborn from the ashes of the Phoenix Project into a high-performing organization that is a strategic partner to the business. This is achieved through the application of a heavy dose of lean thinking (including &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/a&gt;) administered by Erik, a mercurial IT and manufacturing guru Steve is courting to join the board. The book does an excellent job of showing &amp;#8211; as well as telling &amp;#8211; how to apply the concepts (and the effect of doing so) in an enterprise with plenty of technical debt. Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising part of this section is the way in which John has his soul mercilessly crushed to the point where he goes on a multi-day drinking spree before he is rehabilitated towards the end of the book (he is a phoenix too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John&amp;#8217;s narrative arc is just one example of how the book also succeeds as a novel. It&amp;#8217;s gripping, with moments of drama and high emotion, as well as some great one-liners. There was even one point when I teared up (bear in mind that I also cried during Forrest Gump &amp;#8211; unlike the book&amp;#8217;s central characters, I did not serve in the armed forces). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody who has read The Goal will miss The Phoenix Project&amp;#8217;s similarity in terms of style and plot. Perhaps my favourite thing about the book&amp;#8217;s pedagogical style is the way Erik (like Jonah in The Goal) uses the Socratic Method to give Bill the tools to solve his problems by himself. Of course this learning process is fictional, but it means you get to see Bill struggling with the questions and trying things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether readers of the book will be able to apply these techniques as successfully as Bill without a real Erik to guide them. But of course, this is a limitation of any book. If I had one criticism it&amp;#8217;s that unlike real life, there aren&amp;#8217;t many experiments in the book that end up making things worse, and it&amp;#8217;s this process of failing fast, learning from your failures, and coming up with new experiments that is instrumental to a real learning culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important point worth noting if you are working in an organization like Parts Unlimited is this: the IT department&amp;#8217;s rebirth is only possible because of the Titanic proportions of the disaster that unfolds in Part One. For management to truly embrace change, a compelling event or a teachable moment (i.e. a Charlie Foxtrot) is required. Unless your organization faces the same existential threat that Parts Unlimited does, you&amp;#8217;ll have a much harder time convincing people they should adopt the tools described in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, The Phoenix Project is a fantastic read. It&amp;#8217;s entertaining, cathartic, inspirational and informative. If, like me, you have an enormous backlog of books (and more work in process than you&amp;#8217;d like) I suggest giving yourself a break and putting this one to the top of your list. It&amp;#8217;ll only take you a day or two, and despite its conceptual density it will leave you feeling refreshed and energized with a bunch of new ideas to try out. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0988262592?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/a&gt; deserves to be read by everyone who works in &amp;#8211; or with &amp;#8211; IT.&lt;/p&gt;

These types of systems differ in how they respond to volatility: &amp;#8220;The fragile wants tranquility, the antifragile grows from disorder, and the robust doesn&amp;#8217;t care too much.&amp;#8221; (p20) Taleb argues that we want to create systems that are antifragile &amp;#8211; that are designed to take advantage of volatility. I think this concept is incredibly powerful when applied to systems and organizational architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Continuous Delivery Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb shows why the traditional approach of operations &amp;#8211; making change hard, since change is risky &amp;#8211; is flawed: &amp;#8220;the problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks&amp;#8230; These artificially constrained systems become prone to Black Swans. Such environments eventually experience massive blowups&amp;#8230; catching everyone off guard and undoing years of stability or, in almost all cases, ending up far worse than they were in their initial volatile state&amp;#8221; (p105)&lt;a href="#1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This a great explanation of how many attempts to manage risk actually result in &lt;a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/08/risk-management-theatre/"&gt;risk management theatre&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; giving the appearance of effective risk management while actually making the system (and the organization) extremely fragile to unexpected events. It also explains why &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;continuous delivery&lt;/a&gt; works. The most important heuristic we describe in the book is &amp;#8220;if it hurts, do it more often, and bring the pain forward.&amp;#8221; The effect of following this principle is to exert a constant stress on your delivery and deployment process to reduce its fragility so that releasing becomes a boring, low-risk activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Antifragile Systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Taleb&amp;#8217;s key claims is that it is impossible to predict &amp;#8220;Black Swan&amp;#8221; events: &amp;#8220;you cannot say with any reliability that a certain remote event or shock is more likely than another&amp;#8230; but you can state with a lot more confidence that an object or a structure is more fragile than another should a certain event happen.&amp;#8221; (p8). Thus we need &amp;#8220;to switch the blame from the inability to see an event coming&amp;#8230; to the failure to understand (anti)fragility, namely, &amp;#8216;why did we build something so fragile to these types of events?&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; (p136).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike risk, fragility is actually measurable. How do we measure the fragility of the systems we build? We try to break them, using techniques such as &lt;a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371297"&gt;game days&lt;/a&gt; and systems like &lt;a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html"&gt;chaos monkey&lt;/a&gt;. The systematic application of stress to your systems is essential &amp;#8211; not just to ensure your systems are antifragile, but to develop the muscles of the people who create and maintain them through constant practice. After all, it&amp;#8217;s the combination of the system and the people who build and run it that has the quality of antifragility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, an important quality of legacy systems is their fragility. Legacy systems that aren&amp;#8217;t touched for a long time will turn into fragile &amp;#8220;works of art&amp;#8221;: changing them is considered risky, the number of people who understand the system decreases with time, and their knowledge atrophies from lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we create antifragile systems? Apply stress to them continuously so we are forced to simplify, homogenise, and automate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Antifragile Organizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can measure the fragility of an organization by how long it takes before it liquidates its assets. Deloitte&amp;#8217;s Shift Index shows that the average life expectancy of a Fortune 500 company has declined from around 75 years half a century ago to less than 15 years today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start-ups are notoriously fragile. But the ones that survive and grow turn into something potentially more dangerous &amp;#8211; robust organizations. The problem with robust organizations is that they resist change. They aren&amp;#8217;t quickly killed by changes to their environment, but they don&amp;#8217;t adapt to them either &amp;#8211; they die slowly. We see this effect all the time &amp;#8211; changing the culture of an established organization is incredibly hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antifragile organizations are those that have a culture that enables them to learn fast from their environment and adapt to it so they can take advantage of volatility. Here are some characteristics of antifragile organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems thinking.&lt;/strong&gt; Everybody in the organization knows the goals of the organization and makes sure their work is directly contributing towards these goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory Y Management.&lt;/strong&gt; Management needs to assume employees are self-motivated and will be able to learn how to solve problems themselves. Organizations need to make sure they hire antifragile people who will thrive in this environment. As Daniel Pink&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594484805?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;Drive&lt;/a&gt; points out, giving your employees autonomy, purpose, and the opportunity to learn and master new skills is what stops them from quitting, thus increasing the antifragility of your organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous experimentation.&lt;/strong&gt; As described in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071635238?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;Toyota Kata&lt;/a&gt;, good management knows that the best solutions come from the workers. They create an environment in which practitioners are able to run experiments to learn as rapidly as possible. The feedback loops in command and control organizations are too slow for them to adapt effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruptive product development.&lt;/strong&gt; Antifragile organizations aren&amp;#8217;t content with stress generated by their environment. Like humans exercising, they also try and disrupt themselves (the organizational equivalent of a game day). For example, &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/ideacast/2013/01/jeff-bezos-on-leading-for-the.html"&gt;Amazon cannibalized its own business&lt;/a&gt;, creating the Amazon Marketplace and the Kindle. Apple is &lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/10/steve_jobs_solved_the_innovato.html"&gt;cannibalizing its Mac business&lt;/a&gt; with the iPad. Fragile organizations resist disrupting their own product lines, as &lt;a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/processors/25-microchips-that-shook-the-world/5"&gt;Toshiba did at first with flash memory&lt;/a&gt;. If you do a good job at this you never need to worry about the competition &amp;#8211; you&amp;#8217;ll always beat them to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fragility and Agility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Taleb points out, &amp;#8220;antifragility is desirable in general, but not always, as there are cases in which antifragility will be costly, extremely so. Further, it is hard to consider robustness as always desirable&amp;#8212;to quote Nietzsche, one can die from being immortal.&amp;#8221; (p22) Of course working out where on the spectrum you want your systems and your organization to lie is an art, and the great artists are those that know how to build systems, organizations, and products simply, quickly and cheaply so that they are antifragile with respect to our biggest enemy: time. How do they do that? Using the same heuristics described in &amp;#8220;antifragile organizations&amp;#8221;, above, which closely mirror the &lt;a href="http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/"&gt;Three Ways of Devops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067820?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;, it reminded me of something I read a number of years ago: Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321278658?tag=contindelive-20"&gt;Extreme Programming Explained&lt;/a&gt;. The subtitle? Embrace Change. It strikes me that the concept of antifragile is what we were aiming for with agile the whole time: building systems (including human systems &amp;#8211; organizations) that benefit from volatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/badrij"&gt;Badrinath Janakiraman&lt;/a&gt; for feedback on an earlier draft of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; He is talking about financial markets, which are rather less fragile than IT systems, hence his rather generous &amp;#8220;years of stability&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
