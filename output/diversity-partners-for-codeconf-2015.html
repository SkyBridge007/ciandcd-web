<h1>
    Diversity Partners for CodeConf 2015</h1>

<div><p>When a diverse set of presenters and participants comes together for a conference, everyone benefits from the variety of experiences, perspectives and voices in the room. We realize, however, that ticket costs can sometimes be prohibitive for individuals from underrepresented groups. That's why we've partnered with six fantastic organizations to distribute <a href="http://codeconf.com">CodeConf</a> tickets to their members. Each one has a mission to connect, support and/or educate people from backgrounds underrepresented in tech. This will help us build a diverse audience and a great experience for everyone.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2394243/7819632/f46ca1c4-03da-11e5-9851-8a77ad6ca5a3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2394243/7819632/f46ca1c4-03da-11e5-9851-8a77ad6ca5a3.jpg" alt="untitled"></a></p>

<p>Our partner groups have shared a little more about their work and upcoming projects, as well as details of how they're distributing their CodeConf tickets. Read on to get inspired, involved, and potentially grab a ticket for yourself, and remember too that you can help on a personal level by choosing to purchase the "scholarship" ticket option on the
<a href="http://www.ticketbase.com/events/codeconf-2015">registration page</a>.</p>
