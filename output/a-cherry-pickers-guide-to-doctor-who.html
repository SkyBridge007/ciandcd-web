    A Cherry Picker's Guide to Doctor Who</h1>

<div><p>Doctor Who is a British TV series with a long history. Its
    first broadcast was in 1963, and its current incarnation has run
    for eight seasons. Most TV series require you to start at the
    beginning and watch every episode, but although that has its
    delights, you don't have to do that with Doctor Who, since many of
    its best episodes are written so that you can enjoy them as a
    self-contained film. This is my personal suggestions of how to
    watch Doctor Who by cherry picking individual episodes.</p>

<p>For most episodes of Doctor Who, all you need to know is the
    rough premise. The Doctor is a Time Lord, a human looking alien,
    who travels through time and space with various companions
    (usually human, young, and female). This setup allows writers to
    set self-contained stories in any setting: historical, futuristic,
    and current. His spaceship is called the TARDIS, from the outside
    it looks like a blue British Police Box from the 1960s, its inside
    is a large trans-dimensional space. Each episode usually sees the
    Tardis appear and the Doctor and his companion find some sticky
    predicament focused on some malevolent alien. They resolve the
    situation, often with a notable lack of violence. The Doctor is
    strikingly not like the usual action hero, he rarely uses weapons:
    relying on his wits to defeat any threats.</p>

<p>Doctor Who is one of the longest running TV series, it began in
    November 1963. You can divide its history so far into two broad
    periods: Classic Who runs from its beginning until 1989 when
    the series was cancelled. New Who runs from its reboot in 2005 until
    today, where it's still going strong. Classic Who was a children's
    show that appealed to many adults. The writers of New Who mostly
    fell in love with Classic Who as children (as I did) and went on
    to write a show that should appeal equally to adults and children.
    I saw my first episode of New Who with two friends my own age and
    their pre-teen daughters, who hadn't seen Classic Who as we elders
    had.</p>

<p>If you want to explore Doctor Who from scratch, I would start
    with New Who. Classic Who has its charms, and some remarkably good
    serials. But the quality of Classic Who varies from very good to
    truly awful, and comes with special effects that vary from cheesy to
    truly awful. So although I'll suggest a couple of Classic Who serials later
    on, most new viewers should start at New Who. Although there is some
    references to Classic Who, you can appreciate New Who without
    knowing anything about Classic Who.</p>

<p>I'm focusing on cherry picking here, but plenty of people enjoy
    starting from the beginning of New Who and taking a
    completist approach through every episode. There are certainly rewards for the
    completist approach, with some good internal references and many great
    episodes that you can't appreciate by cherry picking. You don't
    need any advice to be a completist, but I will say that you should
    give it until at least the sixth episode (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek_(Doctor_Who_episode)">Dalek</a>)
    before you decide it's not for you. In particular the fourth and
    fifth episodes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_of_London">Aliens of
    London / World War Three</a>) are two of the weakest
    episodes in New Who, with some annoyingly juvenile humor.</p>

<p>For my picks I'm selecting episodes which are both my favorite
    episodes, but also episodes that don't rely on any surronding
    story arc. If it is valuable to see other picked episodes first,
    I'll mention that. There's also an argument for watching some
    individual series completely, and I'll mention which of those I
    think are worth considering for that.</p>

<p>The first question is where does a cherry picker begin, and
    I generally advise starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who)">Blink</a>, which is on most
    people's short list for greatest Who episode ever. It actually
    doesn't feature the Doctor that much, and mostly ignores the
    companion of that series. But it's a clever plot, superbly acted
    by a young Carey Mulligan, and lots of wit in the script.
    Deservedly it won a BAFTA drama award, a rare event for a sci-fi
    story. <a href="#footnote-purpose">[1]</a> The episode was written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat">Stevan
    Moffat</a>, who since went on to be the showrunner for Doctor Who.
    He's also the co-showrunner for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)">Sherlock</a>,
    and the writer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(TV_series)">Jekyll</a> (a
    superb six-episode miniseries).
     I rate him with Joss Whedon as one of the best writers of our
    time.</p>

<p>So start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who)">Blink</a>, but after that you can mostly
    pick and mix as you like. I'm going to list my picks
    chronologically series by series, but you don't have to do them in
    that order. If any episodes require you to see some others first,
    I'll point that out. You should get used to different actors
    playing the Doctor - there is a clever techno-babble reason why
    multiple actors can play the same character, which doesn't affect
    a cherry picking watcher. Each actor emphasizes different aspects
    of the same character. Companions are different people, but again
    the cherry picking choices I've made don't rely too much on their
    ongoing story.</p>

<p>The first series was the reboot of Doctor Who, making it return
    to the screen after a silence of fifteen years. The driving force
    for the reboot was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies">Russel T Davies</a>, who already had garnered a
    fine reputation as a TV writer. Playing the Doctor in this series
    is Christopher Eccleston, sadly in his only series as the Doctor,
    with Rose (Billie Piper) as his companion. The standout episode of
    the first series is Moffat's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Child">The Empty Child / The Doctor
    Dances</a>. Most movies
    aren't this good, and this double episode introduced the Moffat
    approach of combining fright and wit. The other cherry pick I'd
    make from the first series is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek_(Doctor_Who_episode)">Dalek</a>, which reintroduces the
    Doctor's iconic enemy in a story for them that still hasn't been
    surpassed.</p>

<p>The first series also has one of the better story arcs, so may
    be worth doing the full series, if only to really enjoy the final
    two-parter which isn't worth watching without that context. (A tip
    if you do watch the whole series: don't watch the trailer for the
    next episode at the
    end of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Town_(Doctor_Who)">Boom Town</a>, as
    it gives away an important part of the plot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Wolf">Bad Wolf</a>.)</p>

<p>The second
    series has David Tennant playing the tenth Doctor <a href="#footnote-doctor-numbers">[2]</a>. My main cherry pick here
    is again the Moffat episode:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_in_the_Fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>. I also think
    the two parter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Planet">The Impossible Planet / The Satan
    Pit</a> is worth
    watching.</p>

<p>The third series continued with David Tenant but brought in a new
    companion: Martha. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who)">Blink</a> comes from this series, but another
    outstanding highlight of series three is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Nature_(Doctor_Who_episode)">Human Nature / The Family
    of Blood</a>. You do need to have watched a few Whos to really get into
    the Doctor's nature and character to appreciate this one, (I'd
    suggest watching the series 4 picks first). It
    was the first episode for me to reach the same heights as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empty_Child">The Empty Child / The Doctor
    Dances</a></p>

<p>For the fourth series Tenant was joined by the already well-known
    comedienne Catharine Tate as the companion Donna. Again Moffat came
    up with an outstanding thriller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_in_the_Library">Silence in the Library /
    Forest of the Dead</a>. But there are also other great highlights here.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unicorn_and_the_Wasp">The Unicorn and the Wasp</a> is probably the most out-and-out comedy in
    Who, a wonderful send-up of the Agatha Christie country house murder
    mystery (featuring Agatha herself, as only Who can). Russel Davis also
    came up with a taut character-driven thriller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_(Doctor_Who)">Midnight</a>. I also
    really enjoyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_Left_(Doctor_Who)">Turn Left</a>, but am not sure whether to recommend it
    here as it makes many references to non-cherry-picked episodes.
    However I think you can still enjoy it without  following
    those references, if only for some great acting from Tate and
    Bernard Cribbins. </p>

<p>After the fourth season there was a year of specials, which
    generally isn't counted as a series. From this set, I'd pick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waters_of_Mars">The Waters of Mars</a>, which was a fine take on the "base under seige"
    style of Who plot.</p>

<p>With series 5 there was a wholesale change. Russel Davies gave up
    the role of showrunner, handing over to Moffat. Tenant also gave up
    the role of the Doctor. Matt Smith became the eleventh Doctor, and
    we got a new companion in Amy, later joined by her husband Rory. The
    first two episodes of the Moffat era: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eleventh_Hour_(Doctor_Who)">The
    Eleventh Hour</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_Below">The Beast Below</a> are both
    worth picking. I also would pick the two parter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_Angels">The Time of Angels /
    Flesh and Stone</a>,
    although for this one it's important to have seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who)">Blink</a> first (to
    know about The Weeping Angels) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_in_the_Library">Silence in the Library /
    Forest of the Dead</a> to know about River Song. River Song becomes an
    important character in various episodes in series 5 and 6 after
    this. Series 5 is also another good series to watch all the way
    through, with good development up to the finale. But if you want to
    stay with cherry picking, do watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy%27s_Choice_(Doctor_Who)">Amy's Choice</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_and_the_Doctor">Vincent and the Doctor</a><a href="#footnote-vincent">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the traditions of New Who is to have a Christmas special
    episode for broadcast on Christmas Day. Davis did the earlier
    christmas specials, and I don't put any of them on my pick list. But
    I do pick Moffat's first special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Carol_(Doctor_Who)">A
    Christmas Carol</a>, as a clever remix of the Scrooge
    story starring Michael Gambon.</p>

<p>With series 6, Moffat decided to break the pattern of earlier
    series and start the series with a
    two-parter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Astronaut">The
    Impossible Astronaut / Day of the Moon"</a>, which opens
    the series with a bang. The unresolved question from this episode
    may entice you to watch this whole series, and that's not a bad choice.
    If you would rather cherry-pick, you shouldn't miss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Wife">The Doctor's Wife</a> (written by Neil
    Gaiman) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Waited">The Girl Who Waited</a>.</p>

<p>Series 7 is a series of two distinct parts, with a halfway
    split seeing the departure of Amy and Rory and the arrival of the new companion
    Clara. My cherry-picking suggestion here is to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_of_the_Daleks">The Asylum of the Daleks</a> first (which sort-of introduces Clara). Then see
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowmen">The Snowmen</a> which picks up the Doctor after he is sadly
    separated from Amy and Rory and sort-of introduces him to Clara.
    Moffat does some clever meta-textual stuff here, which you can
    only appreciate fully if you're a completist but those two
    episodes still stand strong even without fully getting the
    meta-text in the background. I would also pick out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Horror">The Crimson Horror</a>, which is a comedy with a fun performance from
    Diana Rigg.</p>

<p>Series 7 finishes with the Big Event episode of Who so far, the
    50th anniversary special (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor">The Day of the Doctor</a>), broadcast 50 years after the first
    episode. Naturally there's a huge amount of references for the fans
    in this episode, which unites both Tenant and Smith's Doctor,
    together with John Hurt's sort-of Doctor. It still stands alone for
    pickers, so don't let the lack of background stop you watching it.
    Before you do, however, catch the minisode: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U3jrS-uhuo">The Night of the Doctor</a>
    on youtube. It's a remarkable coup of story-writing to get so much
    into a seven minute episode (although it does help to know that Paul
    McGann played the eighth Doctor, the one that immediately preceded the New Who
    period).</p>

<p>With series 8, Peter Capaldi takes on the role of the twelfth Doctor,
    and brings a darker, less charming Doctor to the scene. Not everyone
    liked this take on the character, but I do as it reminds me of My
    Doctor (the 3rd - Jon Pertwee). It also is my favorite full-series
    arc, with some great character development and interplay between the Doctor and
    Clara. For cherry pickers, however, I'd pick out 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Dalek">Into the Dalek</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_(Doctor_Who)">Listen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_the_Moon">Kill the Moon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_on_the_Orient_Express">Mummy on the Orient Express</a>, but ensure you see the
    others before you see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_on_the_Orient_Express">Mummy on the Orient Express</a> since that last episode
    gains a lot from getting familiar with Capaldi's Doctor.</p>

<p>As I write this, the latest Doctor Who episode was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Christmas_(Doctor_Who)">Last Christmas</a>, the latest
    Christmas Special, which is also a pick for its wonderful mashup of
    Alien, Santa Claus, and another movie you'll recognize.</p>

<p>So how about Classic Who? There's lots of Classic Who, but if
    you're going to explore it, I should pick out a couple of places to start.
    Unlike New Who which goes for single or double episodes, Classic Who
    had short serials of 4-6 half hour episodes. I would start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Death">City of Death</a>, which has the iconic Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor,
    Romana as a Time Lord companion, and a script that clearly shows it
    was part-written by Douglas Adams. After that I have to point you to
    some 3rd Doctor (since he's My Doctor), and pick out
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Monsters">Carnival of
    Monsters</a>, written by Robert Holmes, generally rated as the
    greatest of the Classic Who writers, and features Jo Grant who was
    the companion I best remember. </p>
