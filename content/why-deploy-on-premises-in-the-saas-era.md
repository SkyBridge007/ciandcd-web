When I started in the software industry 10 years ago the idea of

putting your company's crown jewels (source code) on someone else's

infrastructure was preposterous. It was typically the domain of

open-source projects or hobby programmers looking to avoid server

management, taking backups, etc. Although some services have been

around since the late 90's it wasn't until the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source_code_software_hosting_facilities">second
half of the last

decade</a> that 3rd party code hosting became more acceptable,
especially

among SME's. There's been a [proliferation of
providers](http://blog.profitbricks.com/top-source-code-repository-hosts/)
in the space since.

The advantages of SaaS over on-premise deployments has been written

about ad nauseam and there's certainly good reasons why but let's take

a moment to highlight some of the reasons why on-premise is not such a

bad idea after all.
