[Brandon Byars’s](http://twitter.com/BrandonByars) article on
[enterprise REST](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html)
now turns his attention to using consumer-based testing to find
integration problems. This is the approach, counter-intuitive to many,
where we get service consumers to write tests which are incorporated
into the service’s deployment pipeline.
