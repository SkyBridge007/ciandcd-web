[Mike Bland](https://plus.google.com/+MikeBland/posts) concludes his
article on testing culture with some general advice on [how to change a
culture to introduce
testing](http://martinfowler.com/articles/testing-culture.html#culture-change),
generalized from his experience at Google and elsewhere. This finishes
whatâ€™s been a long and fascinating article that really gets into the
nitty-gritty of unit testing at a scale of a large software development
organization. He finishes with a call to action arguing that it is our
professional duty to use techniques like unit testing to prevent
catastrophic bugs like goto fail and heartbleed.
