</p>

GitHub's Game Off is back, and this year it's a little different!

</p>

#### The Challenge

</p>

Take an existing game or game jam entry on GitHub, fork it and do
something awesome with it. You can change the sprites, add a soundtrack,
add a new level, port the game to a different platform, or... go plain
crazy. Tackle it yourself or team up with some friends. Let your
imagination run wild! The theme of the jam is... "**the game has
changed**"!

</p>

You're encouraged to use open source libraries, frameworks, graphics,
and sounds in your game, but you're free to use any technology you want.
The only restriction is that the game should be **web-based** i.e.
playable in a web browser.

</p>

We'll feature some of our favorite and most creative entries on the
GitHub blog.

</p>

#### Where to start

</p>

GitHub is a goldmine of content when it comes to games. Take a look at
the following resources to see if there's one you'd be intersted in
forking and jamming on:
