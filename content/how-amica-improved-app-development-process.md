In a recent case study published by Insurance Networking News, mutual
insurer, Amica, describes how they improved the effectiveness of their
application development process by creating a new practice group that
incorporates DevOps and best practices into the software development
lifecycle. Straight from the trenches, Amica's Information Systems
Officer shares how they: decreased non-code related build failures from
20% to less than 1%, reduced deployment of new web services from several
days to 2 hours, and improved developer software setup from 1.5 days to
25 minutes.
