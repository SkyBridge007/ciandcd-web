[Brettâ€™s](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/) article on the Dependency
Inversion Principle (DIP) and how it works in practice has been a
popular read on this site (over 24,000 views since it was published at
the beginning of the month). Brett has now expanded the article with two
more examples from his delivery experience: questioning requirements and
handling time.
