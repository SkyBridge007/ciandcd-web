A common mistake in service-oriented architectures is to let a single
service own all of the data about widely used entities, such as products
or customers. In his latest installment of [enterprise
REST](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html) [Brandon
Byars](http://twitter.com/BrandonByars) explains why this is an error
and shows how to use the DDD notion of bounded contexts for a better
approach.
