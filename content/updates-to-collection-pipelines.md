Over the last few weeks I’ve been quietly making a bunch of small
updates to [my article on collection
pipelines](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline). To the
main text I’ve added a subsection contrasting them with [Nested Operator
Expressions](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/#NestedOperatorExpressions).
I’ve also added several operators to the [operation
catalog](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/#op-catalog),
including slice and various set operations.
