Title: Collection Pipelines

Slug: collection-pipelines

I’ve often come across a pattern in code where you organize some
computation by passing collections through a pipeline of operations. I
first came across it in Unix, did it in Smalltalk and Ruby, and find it
common in functional programming. I’ve written [an
article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline) to
describe this pattern, and this is the first installment which contains
an initial introduction and a definition of the pattern.
