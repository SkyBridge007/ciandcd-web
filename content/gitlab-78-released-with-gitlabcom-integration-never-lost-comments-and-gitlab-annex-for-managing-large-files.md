This is an exciting day. Today we release GitLab 7.8, the biggest
release of GitLab ever. This release alone contains over 60 entries in
the [GitLab CE
changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG)!

We're very proud to show you the new features and improvements of GitLab
Community Edition (CE) and GitLab Enterprise Edition.

</p>

GitLab Community edition brings among others, a GitLab.com importer,

new files in an empty repository, never-lost comments and group
mentions.

GitLab Enterprise Edition adds to this the GitLab Annex feature to
manage your large files with GitLab, improved JIRA integration and a
GitHub Enterprise integration.

This month's Most Valuable Person ([MVP](https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/))
is Hannes Rosen√∂gger.

Hannes took stale or old merge requests, fixed them up and contributed
them to GitLab.

This is a great way to contribute and we're excited for him to join the
core team.

Thanks Hannes!
