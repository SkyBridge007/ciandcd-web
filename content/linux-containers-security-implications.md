Does the word “container” intimate containment, suggesting that
containers are inherently secure? If it does, any such assumption of
security may be the broadest Docker vulnerability to date. “One of the
biggest threats I see with Docker is its positioning and the implied
security in the language. The reality is that these containers don’t
contain anything,” says Aaron Cois, Researcher, CERT Division, Software
Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. Yet, that is the
implication. Just as those who thought Linux or VMs were secure enough
on their own were mistaken, so those who believe that containers put a
lid on security will be sorely disappointed. Today, Linux environments
require network, OS / host security, Internet security, and web
application security measures similar to those used with other
platforms. Tools like security auditing / PEN testing, firewalls / WAFs,
anvi-virus and anti-malware tools, DLP, IDS/IPS, remediation tools, and
really the gamut of security measures similar to what Microsoft
environments require are increasingly needed to defend data in Linux
environments. “Likewise, operations can...
