[Diana Larsen](http://futureworksconsulting.com/) and [James
Shore](http://jamesshore.com/) were actively involved with agile

methods before they were fashionable. They have spent many years helping

organizations explore agile development and I’ve always found their

opinions worth listening to. When I get requests to review articles I
rarely

have time to read them, but a recent request by this pair piqued

my interest.

When I read their draft on the stages of agile fluency, I immediately

offerred to publish it on my site. The article looks at how teams

pass through four stages of fluency with agile methods. Each stage

brings benefits, but demands investment. Not all teams should go

through all the stages. The model they’ve come up with is nicely

simple and resonates with tales told by my colleagues. I think it

provides a good framework for thinking about the style of agile

development you are at and where you want to be.
