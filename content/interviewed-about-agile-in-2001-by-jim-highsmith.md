When I went to Snowbird in 2001 for the meeting that led to the
[Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/),

Jim interviewed me for the book he was writing on
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Software-Development-Ecosystems-Highsmith/dp/0201760436/">Agile
Software

Development Ecosystems</a>. It provides a snapshot on my thinking

on extreme programming and this thing that a few days later we called

agile software development.
