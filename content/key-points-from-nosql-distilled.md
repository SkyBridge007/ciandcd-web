One the aspects of our design for NoSQL Distilled is that most

chapters finish with a section of key points - short bullets that

summarize the content of the chapter. Iâ€™ve now turned these into a web

page that thus provides a summary of the key points of the book -

which can act is a quick refresher for those that have the book and an

indication of the content of the book for those who are contemplating

buying it.
