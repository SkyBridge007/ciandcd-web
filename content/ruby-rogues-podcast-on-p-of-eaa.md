The Ruby Rogues are a popular podcast where a regular panel discusses
topics in the Ruby programming community. They have a regular book club
and recently selected [P of EAA](http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html)
as their featured book. Consequently they asked me to appear as a guest
on their show to discuss the book and the patterns that it describes, in
particular the interesting relationship between these patterns and the
Rails framework.
