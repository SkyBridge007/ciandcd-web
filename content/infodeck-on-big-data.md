“Big Data” has leapt rapidly into one of the most hyped terms in our
industry, yet the hype should not blind people to the fact that this is
a genuinely important shift about the role of data in the world. The
amount, speed, and value of data sources is rapidly increasing. Data
management has to change in five broad areas: extraction of data from a
wider range of sources, changes to the logistics of data management with
new database and integration approaches, the use of agile principles in
running analytics projects, an emphasis on techniques for data
interpretation to separate signal from noise, and the importance of
well-designed visualization to make that signal more comprehensible.
Summing up this means we don’t need big analytics projects, instead we
want the new data thinking to permeate our regular work. [(go to the
