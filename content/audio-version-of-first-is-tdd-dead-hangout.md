Here is [an audio version of our first
hangout](http://assets.thoughtworks.com/podcast/is-tdd-dead-episode-1-09-may-2014.mp3),
for those of you who, like me, can’t stand watching video. It’s a raw
translation of the video’s audio. We may try to do something more
refined later, such as sorting out a podcast feed, but it’s not
something we’ve done before so it may take a while for us to get around
to it.
