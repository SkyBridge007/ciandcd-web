[Brandon Byars](http://twitter.com/BrandonByars) concludes his [article
on using REST-style services for enterprise
integration](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html) by
describing how to coordinate features across services. His advice is to
use the agile planning notions of stories and epics - using stories
within a service and epics to coordinate across services. When doing
this itâ€™s important to track progress at the program level because you
only deliver business value when all the services involved in an epic
are done.
