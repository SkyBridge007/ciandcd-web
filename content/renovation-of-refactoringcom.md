Title: Renovation of refactoring.com
Date: 2013-12-10 14:43
Slug: renovation-of-refactoringcom

After I finished
[Refactoring](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html), I created
a small web site at [refactoring.com](http://refactoring.com) to act as
an online summary of the refactorings in the book. It’s mainstay is a
[catalog](http://refactoring.com/catalog/) which provides a brief
summary of each refactoring. I built it around 2000 and until today it
still was very much a product of the late 90’s. Over the last few weeks
I’ve changed its appearance, made a more dynamic catalog page with some
interactive filters, redrawn the diagrams, and added some deep links to
the relevant pages of [Safari Books
Online](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/0-201-485672/ch06lev1sec1). I’ve
also added links and refactorings from the [ruby
edition](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html) of the
book.
