I recently needed to write a simple script to pull some data

from a Google website. Since I was grabbing some private data, I

needed authorize myself to do that. I found it much more work than

I expected, not because it's hard, but because there wasn't much

documentation there to guide me - I had to puzzle out what path

to go based on lots of not particularly relevant documentation. So

once I'd figured it out I decided to write a short account of what

I'd done, partly in case I need to do this again, and partly to

help anyone else who wants to do this.
