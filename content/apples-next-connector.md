A couple of years ago, Apple computers started appearing with a
“Thunderbolt” interface to connect to monitors and disks. Some time
after that, new iPhones appeared with a smaller connector called
“Lightning”. Should we thus conclude that Apple’s next connector will be
called “Very, Very Frightening”?
