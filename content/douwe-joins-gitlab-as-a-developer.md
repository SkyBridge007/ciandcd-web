</p>

Starting today, Douwe Maan is joining the GitLab team as a software
developer. He will strengthen the (already very impressive) development
team to help us deliver new features even faster.

</p>

Douwe caught the programming virus at the age of 9, got his first
freelance job 2 years later, and has spent the years that followed
gaining experience with a wide range of technologiesâ€”both by himself and
as lead developer at two startups.

</p>

Some 3 years ago, he found Ruby and fell in love with the language and
the open-source community surrounding it, making him a perfect fit for
GitLab.

</p>

Always looking for a challenge, Douwe combines shaping the future of
version control with completing his Computer Science studies at Utrecht
University in the Netherlands.

</p>

Please join us in welcoming him to the team!
