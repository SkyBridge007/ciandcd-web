Next month I’ll be spending a chunk of time in Europe. I have two

talks lined up. Firstly I’ll be turning up in Aarhus at [my favorite
conference](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/)

where I’ll be kicking off the NoSQL track on October 3rd with
<a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Introduction%20to%20NoSQL">an
introduction to

NoSQL</a> - roughly based on material from [NoSQL
Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html).

</p>

Then, on October 4, I’ll be [speaking in Berlin at a ThoughtWorks
event](http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/martin-fowler-jez-humble-berlin)

with [Jez Humble](http://continuousdelivery.com/). For that I’ll do one
of my usual [Suites of
Talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html).

There will be some NoSQL in the suite, but probably mixed with some

other material too.
