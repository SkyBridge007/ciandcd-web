Title: Update on malware issue with ThoughtWorks web sites

Iâ€™ve posted [an article detailing our malware
attack](http://martinfowler.com/../articles/malware.html). The

short form is that we believe our sites are clear, but we currently

have to operate them with reduced functionality. The malware only

attacks a small proportion of visitors (which is part of what makes it

difficult to deal with). However if you have visited our sites since

Christmas with a windows machine, you should read more.
