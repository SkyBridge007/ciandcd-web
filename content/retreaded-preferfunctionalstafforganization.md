For as long as I've been in software there's been a debate

between
[FunctionalStaffOrganization](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionalStaffOrganization.html)
and

[TechnicalStaffOrganization](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalStaffOrganization.html).
The debate occurs within project teams,

and across whole IT organizations. It's a constant debate because

both sides have good logical arguments to support them, and there's

no real way to test which has an advantage in practice.

</p>

Despite the fact that I acknowledge this, I greatly prefer a

functional organization. I say this knowing there are exceptions and

you can't follow one route all the time. But I'd rather side with

too much functional orientation than the other way around.

</p>

For me the compelling factor is that of the aligning of

application teams to business value. I very much believe in the

irresistibility of
<a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/Conways-Law.html">Conway's

Law</a> and see the setting of an
[ApplicationBoundary](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ApplicationBoundary.html)
to be

primarily a social construct. Since the whole point of software

development is to serve its customers, then the organization should

reflect this - yielding teams that are focused on providing business

value rather than delving deep into technical esoterica.

</p>

Fundamentally the argument of

[TechnicalStaffOrganization](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalStaffOrganization.html)
rests on efficiency - that it's

wasteful to duplicate systems and that people are more efficient if

they specialize. I won't deny that you get duplication if you use a

functional organization, but I'm not so convinced it's so

wasteful. After all many people believed a centralized, planned

economy was bound to be more efficient than the wasteful duplication

of capitalist competition. I'm wary of stretching too much of a parallel

between macro-economics and software development, but I suspect the

same issue underlies each of them - human motivation. When people are

focused away from solving business problems, all sorts of factors

creep in that introduce inefficiencies far greater than the

duplication that a technical organization is designed to solve.

</p>

I also think there's an inevitability here. Business units need

applications, if they don't get them they will build their own,

creating a functional organization by default. After all they have

the money and power - essentially the same dynamics as drive the

boom-bust cycle of
[EnterpriseArchitecture](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EnterpriseArchitecture.html).

</p>

So I think that *most* of the time you should organize

functionally. But that doesn't mean that you should be blind to the

problems of the approach. Duplicate work and lack of technical

specialization will be serious problems, and you'll need to do things to

counter those problems. They're just better problems to have than

the alternative.
