The [hangout overview
page](http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/) now has links to
the video and audio from the 3rd “Is TDD Dead” hangout, together with my
written summary of the hangout. In this session we talk about the
trade-offs and nature of feedback and the TDD’s influence on QA. The
[next hangout](http://bit.ly/1tfAWmk) will be next Tuesday May 27th at
1100 Eastern time.
