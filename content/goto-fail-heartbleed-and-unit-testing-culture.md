The “goto fail” and heartbleed bugs have shaken our confidence in the
security and privacy of the internet. [Mike
Bland](https://plus.google.com/+MikeBland/posts) believes that a culture
of unit testing would greatly reduce the chances that such bugs would
escape into production. As part of a group that spread such a culture
inside Google, he believes that it’s important for software teams to
take on such a culture. He is writing an article that will look at how
unit testing could catch the “goto fail” and heartbleed bugs, the costs
and benefits of a testing culture, and the experience of instilling this
culture at Google. [This first installment looks in detail at the “goto
fail” bug](http://martinfowler.com/articles/testing-culture.html) and
how a testing culture would examine that code.
