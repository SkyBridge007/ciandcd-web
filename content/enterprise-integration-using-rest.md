My colleague Brandon Byars has been involved in several projects in
large enterprises where they are trying to upgrade and replace their
legacy systems. A strategy that’s been useful in these situations is
using REST-style web-services as an integration mechanism. Brandon is
writing an article to discuss the lessons learned from this, which talks
less about things like HATEOS and more on the role of environment
management, versioning, and contract evolution. This first edition of
the article talks about the importance of defining logical environments,
and he’ll be publishing more sections to the article over the next few
weeks.
