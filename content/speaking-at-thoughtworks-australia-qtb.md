Next week I’m heading off to spend some time in Australia (thankfully

away from all this snow-shovelling). While I’m there I’ll be

participating in a series of [Quarterly Technology
Briefings](http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/thoughtworks-quarterly-briefing-continuous-delivery).
These

will take the form of a panel Q&A on [Continuous
Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/delivery.html). On the

panel I shall be over-shadowed by [Neal
Ford](http://memeagora.blogspot.com/) and we will both be

over-shadowed by [Evan Bottcher](http://evan.bottch.com/).
