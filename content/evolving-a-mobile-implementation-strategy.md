Earlier this year Giles Alexander and I spoke at our ThoughtWorks live
events on strategies for mobile applications. Here is the video from the
London talk. We talk about the “Lean-forward”, “Lean-back”, and
“Look-down” engagement styles; why value can be hidden by traffic, and
the cover-your-bases and laser platform strategies. Giles finishes with
a brief case study of using this thinking at a major airline.
