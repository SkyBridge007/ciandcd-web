Title: Facebook page for my tweets

Slug: facebook-page-for-my-tweets

I’ve [been using Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/martinfowler) for a few
years to post about what

I’m up to, new activity on martinfowler.com, and other interesting

things I find on the internets. Facebook has a facility to feed

twitter activity to a Facebook page, which is handy for people who

prefer tracking my posts on Facebook rather than Twitter. So I’ve set

up a [Facebook page to channel my
tweets](http://www.facebook.com/martinFowlerThoughtWorks). If you “like”

that page, Facebook will add my tweets to your Facebook news feed.

</p>

I don’t intend to do anything more with this page than be a channel

for my tweets, so this won’t be anything new for people who

use Twitter, but I’m giving it a try to see if at least some people

prefer to use Facebook.
