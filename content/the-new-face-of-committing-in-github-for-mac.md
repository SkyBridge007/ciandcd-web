We’ve just redesigned [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com)’s Changes
tab to make it even easier to review lots of changes, and to see what
will be shared before clicking Sync:

This means that you can focus solely on what’s most important to you:
your changes.

</p>

We’ve also simplified and improved the process for fixing up a commit
you’ve just made. Just click the “Undo” button in the pane that appears:

</p>

And if you don’t want to worry about manually syncing your changes after
committing, you can enable “Automatically Sync after Committing” from
the Edit menu:

This is yet another step toward our grand vision for GitHub for Mac,
with plenty more to come, so [give it a shot](https://mac.github.com)!
If you already have GitHub for Mac installed, it will update itself to
the latest version automatically.

</p>

As always, we’d love to know what you think. If you have any comments,
questions or bug reports, please [let us
know](https://github.com/contact).
