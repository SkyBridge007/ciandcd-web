ThoughtWorks recently announced the open-sourcing of our product Go -
which supports Continuous
[Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/delivery.html). This kind of event
tends to raise questions, so I organized [an interview with Chad
Wathington](http://martinfowler.com/articles/go-interview.html), who is
a Managing Director of ThoughtWorks Studios (our product division). He
answers questions on why we did the open-sourcing, why we announced it
before making the source available, about the name-clash with the go
language, and our future plans for Go.
