Earlier this year I gave a keynote at the OOP conference in Munich. I
gave two short talks (about 25 minutes each), both of which are now
available on YouTube. The first talk looks at the topic of [Workflows of
Refactoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqEg37e4Mkw), where I
explore various ways in which people can (but often donâ€™t) use
refactoring in their work. In the [second
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8aECe4lp44) I begin with my
concern about the biggest aspect missing from the spread of agile and go
on to explore the relationship between programmers, analysts, users and
the wider society. (I have a [list of all videos of my
talks](http://martinfowler.com/tags/talk%20videos.html) and a [YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJb2p0qX8R_r3crCVAxp57dvoqGGjD3yD)
for those on YouTube.)
