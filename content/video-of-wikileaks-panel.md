I enjoyed the Churchill Club panel discussion on wikileaks on

Wednesday. It’s thoughtful and well worth watching [the
video](http://fora.tv/2011/01/19/WikiLeaks_Why_It_Matters_Why_It_Doesnt).

I particularly appreciated Daniel Ellsberg’s picture of the climate of

government secrecy and Roy’s call to follow the example of librarians

resisting secret gag orders. (There was a bit were it threatens to sink

deep into the nature of libertarianism, but fortunately that didn’t

last long.) While my thoughts on wikileaks are

complicated (and I’ve not had the energy to write about them) I think

the incident raises some very serious issues around the contending

forces of privacy and openness. This panel provides a useful briefing

on some of these perspectives.
