[Toby Clemson](http://github.com/tobyclemson) continues his discussion
of [techniques for testing
microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/),
with two more styles of testing. [Integration
tests](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#testing-integration-introduction)
probe the interaction a service has with its data stores and external
components. [Component
tests](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#testing-component-introduction)
provide a coarse-grained test of the entire service, which can be
usefully performed both in-process and out-of-process.
