[Brandon Byars](http://twitter.com/BrandonByars) continues his article
on [using REST-style services for enterprise
integration](http://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html) by
discussing versioning. Or more to the point, explaining why you
shouldnâ€™t use versioning unless you really need to. You can reduce the
pain of versioning by using techniques like tolerant readers, semantic
versioning, and writing stories at service boundaries.
