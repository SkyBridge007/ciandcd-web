If you’re a subscriber to Safari Books Online, you will soon see a

copy of a [rough cut of NoSQL
Distilled](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780133036138). This morning
I said it

was available, but I’ve since learned that my Safari account has

special privileges, so I was seeing it but others cannot. We expect it

to be available in the next couple of days for everyone who has an

account that includes rough cuts.

</p>

It’s a rough cut, so it’s still early in the production process, with

few copy-edits done. But it gives you an early chance to take a look

at the text and to pass on comments.

</p>

[Safari Books Online](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/) is an online
library that gives access

to lots of software books, including those of Pearson and O’Reilly.

They have various levels of subscription, only some of which include

rough cuts. For example there are two levels of individual

subscription: bookshelf and library. Only the (more expensive) library

individual subscription gives access to rough cuts.

I’m sorry for any confusion I’ve caused by my premature announcement.
