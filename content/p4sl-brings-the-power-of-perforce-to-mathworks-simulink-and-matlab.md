The world of [model-based
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_design) got a big
boost last week with the release of
[P4SL](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-p4sl-for-simulink/),
our Open Source integration with [Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com)’
flagship products,
[Simulink](http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink), the leading
simulation and modeling tool, and
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/), the popular
numerical computing environment.

</p>

Simply put, you can now perform all the most common Perforce operations
from within Simulink and MATLAB on pretty much any object you can
right-click on—in most cases, there’s no longer a need to context-switch
between Perforce and Simulink or MATLAB.
