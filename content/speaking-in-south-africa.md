Next month I’ll be travelling to South Africa again for the first time
in over ten years. I’m going down to give a keynote at the [Agile Africa
conference](http://agileafrica.jcse.org.za) in Johannesburg on August
12/13. I’ll also be popping down to Cape Town on Thursday 15th (details
and links to follow when I have them).
