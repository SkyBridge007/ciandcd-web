There are various ways in which refactoring can fit into our

programming workflow. One useful notion is that of Preparatory

Refactoring. This is where I'm adding a new feature, and I see

that the existing code is not structured in such a way that

makes adding the feature easy. So first I refactor the code into

the structure that makes it easy to add the feature, or as Kent

Beck pithily put it "make the change easy, then make the easy

change".

</p>

It always helps to use examples to explain things, and

so I took the opportunity when I ran into a case while adding a

new feature to my publication toolchain.
