[Sid Pinney](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sidpinney) often takes on the
job of investigating new locations for

ThoughtWorks offices. He’s been one of the first to help start our

offices in England, China, and Brazil. Last week I got an email saying

he’s investigating possibilities in Vancouver. He’s looking for people

to talk to: so if you’re a prospective client, possible employee, or

are just friendly and looking to have Sid buy you a free food - get in

touch with him by
[email](http://martinfowler.com/mailto:sgpinney@thoughtworks.com) or
