A couple of weeks ago I did a joint talk with my colleague [Molly
Bartlett Dishman](https://twitter.com/mollyelise) about the [interaction
of agile software development and application
architecture](http://www.thoughtworks.com/talks/agile-architecture-rethink-2014).
We talk how these two activities overlap, explaining that architecture
is a vital part of a successful agile project. We then move on to
passing on tips for how to ensure that the architecture work is
happening.

</p>

This talk was part of ThoughtWorks’s [“Rethink”
event](http://www.thoughtworks.com/conferences/rethink-dallas-2014)in
Dallas. There are also excellent talks by [Brandon
Byars](https://twitter.com/BrandonByars) on how [enterprises should be
restructured](http://www.thoughtworks.com/talks/rethinking-the-agile-enterprise)
to take advantage of agile thinking and by [“Pragmatic” Dave
Thomas](http://pragdave.me) on the dangers of “agile” being [co-opted by
the big-methodology
crowd](http://www.thoughtworks.com/talks/the-death-of-agile) that it was
designed to oppose. (The latter is worth it just to enjoy Dave in a suit
and tie.)

</p>

Molly and I will be reprising and updating our talk for the [O’Reilly
Architecture conference](http://softwarearchitecturecon.com/sa2015) in
March next year.
