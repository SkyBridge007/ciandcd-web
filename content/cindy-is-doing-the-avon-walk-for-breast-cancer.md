Last year Cindy, my wife, did Boston’s Avon walk to raise money for

breast cancer research. She decided to it again this year. Last year a

good proportion of the money she raised came from my readers, and

we’re hoping we can get another round of support from you this

year. If you’d like to donate, please go to her
