I’m going to Germany next week and we’ve added a third speaking event

to my trip. As well as speaking at
[OOP](http://www.sigs-datacom.de/oop2011/oop2011-eng/latest-news.html)
in Munich and in [Cologne](http://jugcologne.eu/),

ThoughtWorks has organized a [speaking event in
Hamburg](http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/software-design-21st-century-deutschland)
on Jan

31st. My colleagues Erik Döernenburg and Wolf Schlegel will give a

talk on Continuous Deployment and I’ll follow with my usual

[SuiteOfTalks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html).
