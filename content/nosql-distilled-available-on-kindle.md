Amazon now has [NoSQL
Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html) available on
Kindle, so those of

you who prefer that format can now get an instant fix of our deathless

prose. If you prefer an epub ebook, then InformIT will have that soon,

but they are still showing pre-order. I donâ€™t know why the ebook

versions have been so laggardly - but I know enough to blame

computers.
