[Badri Janakiraman](https://twitter.com/badrij) and I continue [our
video conversation about hexagonal
Rails](http://martinfowler.com/articles/badri-hexagonal) by looking into
how we should work with the Rails framework. We posit that when you work
with a framework like Rails you should decide to either treat it as a
platform, meaning you embrace it into your application, or as suite of
components, treating each aspect as an independently replaceable unit.
