Roughly twice a year the ThoughtWorks [Technology Advisory Board
(TAB)](http://martinfowler.com/articles/radar-faq.html#tab) produces its
Technology Radar - a snapshot of technologies that we find are worth
tracking. Weâ€™ve now published the [January 2014
radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar), with a nice interactive web
version in addition to the usual PDFs.
