Video of the one-hour overview presentation that Jez and I gave at YOW

at the end of last year. We cover the rationale for Continuous

Delivery, the deployment pipeline, continuous integration, devops, and

deployment strategies. The highlight is Jezâ€™s personification of a

release candidate as a hero in a greek myth.
