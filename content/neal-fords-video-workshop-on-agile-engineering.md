My colleague Neal Ford is a frequent writer and speaker who shares

many of my interests and opinions (and is an excellent source of ideas

for me to clip). In 2009-10 he wrote a
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-eaed1/index.html">series
of fifteen

articles</a> for IBM developerWorks which dug deeper into the

question of evolutionary architecture and design. His topics included

Test Driven Development, leveraging reusable code, refactoring towards

design and Domain-Specific Languages.

</p>

Now he’s followed on from this and recorded a
<a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/video/-/9781449314439">video
workshop on Agile

Engineering Practices</a> for

O’Reilly that’s available on safari books online. These cover much of

the topics that make evolutionary design possible, including

Test-Driven Design, automation, and testing strategies.
