Last week I sat with the [Ruby
Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler/)
- a podcast about development in the Ruby and Rails world ([Avdi
Grimm](http://devblog.avdi.org/), [Jessica
Kerr](http://blog.jessitron.com/) and host [Charles Max
Wood](https://twitter.com/cmaxw)). They have a regular book club, and
their book this time was the [Ruby
edition](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html) of
[Refactoring](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) We talked
about the definition of refactoring, why we find we donâ€™t use debuggers
much, what might be done to modernize the book, the role of refactoring
tools, whether comments can be used for good, the trade-off between
refactoring and rewriting, modularity and microservices, and how the
software industry has changed over the last twenty years.
