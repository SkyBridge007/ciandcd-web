I’ll be speaking in Dallas on Saturday December 6th for a [ThoughtWorks
event](http://info.thoughtworks.com/rethink) We have also got Dave
“Pragmatic” Thomas in, to talk about the death of agile. I’ll be
speaking with my colleague, Molly Bartlett Dishman, about how
architecture works in an agile environment.
