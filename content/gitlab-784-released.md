Today we release GitLab 7.8.4 CE, EE and GitLab CI 7.8.4.

You might have noticed that 7.8.3 was not announced. It contained a fix
for annotated tags without a message which was required for the
Gitorious import on GitLab.com.

GitLab 7.8.4 CE contains:

</p>

-   Fix for custom issue trackers where `issue_tracker_id` is being
    replaced in all links.
-   Fix for duplicate paths and names in namespaces.

</p>

Enterprise Edition 7.8.4 contains the fixes from 7.8.4 CE.
