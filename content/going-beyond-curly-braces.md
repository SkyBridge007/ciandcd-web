On my long flight down to Australia recently I dug into a copy of

[Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks](http://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).
I spent less than seven hours

on it, but found it a worthwhile read. He takes a lightening tour

through seven languages. It’s not enough to go into much depth on any

them, but it is enough to get a rough feel what’s interesting about

them. I’d particularly recommend it if you are just starting to

explore beyond the curly-brace languages that dominate so much of

current programming.

One thing I particularly appreciate about pragprog books is that you

get access to electronic versions in multiple formats. This book

worked very well on the Kindle, despite the small screen.
