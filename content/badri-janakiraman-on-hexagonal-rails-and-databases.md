The recent series of videos on [Is TDD
Dead](http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/) has led to many
interesting discussions. One of these was an email exchange I had with
my colleague [Badri Janakiraman](https://twitter.com/badrij), who is a
long-time ThoughtWorker with a lot of experience in Rails and other
development stacks. We decided to video this conversation, as I thought
some other people would enjoy it too. Our conversation looks at the
Hexagonal Rails approach, what it is, and when itâ€™s appropriate. [This
first video](http://martinfowler.com/articles/badri-hexagonal)
introduces the notion of Hexagonal Architecture, and talks about how it
effects the relationship with the database - which ends up being a
choice between the Active Record and Data Mapper patterns.
