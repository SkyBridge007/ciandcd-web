Like many of us, my colleague [Patrick Kua](http://thekua.com/atwork)
has seen a lot of use of metrics. Management love their metrics. The
thinking goes something like this, “We need a number to measure how
we’re doing. Numbers focus people and help us measure success.” Whilst
well intentioned, management by numbers unintuitively leads to
problematic behavior and ultimately detracts from broader project and
organizational goals. Metrics inherently aren’t a bad thing; just often,
inappropriately used. [This
essay](http://martinfowler.com/articles/useOfMetrics.html) demonstrates
many of the issues caused by management’s traditional use of metrics and
offers an alternative to address these dysfunctions.
