When I wrote Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, I

coined what I called the First Law of Distributed Object Design:

“don’t distribute your objects”. In recent months there’s been a lot

of interest in microservices, which has led a few people to ask

whether microservices are in contravention to this law, and if so

why I am in favor of them?
