At goto Denmark this year, I was on a [panel discussing the past,
present, and future of agile software
development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNvmjPzdqKc). I talked
about the past, Prag Dave Thomas took a cynical look at the present, and
Jez Humble, Katherine Kirk and Tatiana Badiceanu looked at where it was
going.
