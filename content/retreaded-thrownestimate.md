If you're using XP style planning, you need to get rapid consensus

estimates from developers. Throwing the estimates lets you quickly

tell when developers have same similar views on an estimate (so you

can note it and move on) or if there is disagreement (when you need

to talk about the
[UserStory](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html) in more
detail.

</p>

Here's the basic sequence. The customer puts together the list of

stories that need to estimated. With each story:

</p>

-   The customer briefly describes the stories to the developers
-   Developers ask clarifying questions about the story. They

    </p>
    shouldn't discuss technical issues about how to implement, just

    <p>
    ask about scope from the customer's point of view.

-   On the count of three, the developers show fingers to indicate

    </p>
    their estimate of how many
    [NUTs](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html) there are in
    the story. I call

    this a thrown estimate because you can use the same style of pacing

    throws that you use

    for <a href="http://www.worldrps.com/gbasics.html">Rock Paper

    <p>
    Scissors.</a>.

-   If most estimates are similar the scribe notes down the

    </p>
    estimate. If you get a significant variation in estimate then you

    should discuss the story further - bringing in the technical issues
    of

    <p>
    how to implement it.

You can use different conventions for how many fingers to

use. One project I've seen uses 1 or 2 fingers to indicate 1 or 2

NUTs and three fingers to indicate the story is too big and needs

splitting up. Another group uses fingers for 1-4 NUTs and five

fingers to indicate it's too large. Notice that it's important to

have a convention to say that a story has a problem and can't be

estimated - most often because it's too big, but also if it can't be

tested or there's some other problem.

</p>

Teams using this report that they are able to estimate stories at

a very rapid rate, avoiding much discussion on stories that are

straightforward to estimate and concentrating time on those that are

more problematic. This keeps everyone engaged in the estimating

process. It also helps that it's fun.
