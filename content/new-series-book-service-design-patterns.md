Addison-Wesley has published a new book in my Signature Series. It’s

by Robert Daigneau and it’s called Service Design Patterns. It’s a topic

that’s already had too many books on it, but I added this one to the

series because I think Robert has done a particularly good job of

collecting together the best advice on the topic and organizing it into

a useful handbook. This is the book that I think ought to become the

standard book on the topic.
