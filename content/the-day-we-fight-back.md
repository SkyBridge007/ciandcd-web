ThoughtWorks is joining with several organizations, including the EFF,
Reddit, Mozilla, and Demand Progress in a call to the international
community to fight against mass surveillance. If you are concerned about
the growth of mass surveillance of our internet communications, I urge
you to see how you can take part. On February 11th, many websites will
be adding banners to their site encouraging people to make their
opinions known, particularly those in the U.S. concerned about how our
government is indulging in behavior that can lead to undermining
democracy.

To find out more please visit <https://thedaywefightback.org> where you
can find out how to join in by adding a banner to your web site. For
more background on the rationale behind this day of action, read [this
statement from the
EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/february-11-day-we-fight-back-calling-international-community).

important](http://martinfowler.com/articles/bothersome-privacy.html),
even if you think you have nothing to hide.
