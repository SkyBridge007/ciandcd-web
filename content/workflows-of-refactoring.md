Refactoring has turned into a well-known technique, but many teams don’t
seem to use it as much as they could. In this infodeck, I explore
various workflows you can use to integrate refactoring into your
programming work - helped by using the “Two Hats” metaphor. These
include TDD Refactoring, Litter-Pickup Refactoring, Comprehension
Refactoring, Preparatory Refactoring, Planned Refactoring, and Long-Term
Refactoring. While not any kind of exhaustive taxonomy, I hope they’ll
give teams ideas on how they can extend the use of refactoring to
improve their delivery speed.
