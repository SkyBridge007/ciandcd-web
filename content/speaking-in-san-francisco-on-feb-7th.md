I’ll be giving a talk in San Francisco on February 7th. I don’t know
exactly what my topics will be, but it will be a [Suite of
Talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html). Also on the
program is my colleague [Ken Collier](http://theagilist.com), who will
be talking about whether Big Data is any more than a load of old hype.
