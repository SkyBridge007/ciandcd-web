QCon invited [Rebecca](http://www.thoughtworks.com/rebecca-parsons) and
I to do a [keynote at QCon
London](http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/The%20Data%20Panorama)
(March

7). Over the last year or so we’ve been seeing more and more of a

change in how organizations think about data, so that seems a natural

choice to talk about. Our clients are seeing larger volumes of data,

that they need to analyze more quickly and more cleverly. We’re seeing

[different technologies for data
storage](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/NosqlDefinition.html) that have
loosened the

vice-like grip of relational databases. And we find our profession

needs to start thinking about what our responsibilities are in

managing all of this information.
