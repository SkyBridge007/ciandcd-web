At goto Aarhus this year, there was a theme on internet

privacy. Tim Bray gave a keynote on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pHx_1tlGN0">state of

browsers</a> which touched on this issue and later gave a full

conference talk on the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95BrHJsUY-g">state of internet

privacy and security</a>. Erik Dörnenburg and I gave a keynote

explaining why we feel it is the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNaeVQhrsyY">responsibility of

developers to defeat mass surveillance</a>. Our colleague Ola

Bini, who is very active in the internet security world himself,

felt this was a good opportunity to get all of us together to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQIVFhBmbU">discuss

these issues in an interview</a>.
