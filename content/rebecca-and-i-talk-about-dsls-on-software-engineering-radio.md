I’ve long been a fan of the podcast series
<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering

Radio</a>. The team there have built an excellent series of podcasts

on various aspects of software development and I often listen to them

while taking my afternoon walk. So I’m glad to get a spot on there

myself. In this episode I’m on the program with Rebecca Parsons, my

colleague and co-author of my [DSL
book](http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html) to talk about DSLs. We
talk

about what DSLs are, the differences between internal and external

DSLs, and when you should (and shouldn’t use DSLs). The episode is

hosted by [Markus Völter](http://www.voelter.de/), who, of course, is a
considerable expert on DSLs too

- so it’s really a three way conversation on the topic.
