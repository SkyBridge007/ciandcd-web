We recently caught up with some of our friends at [Epic
Games](http://epicgames.com/) in Cary, NC a few weeks ago to talk about
the latest developments with [Unreal
Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4) and
[Unreal Tournament](http://www.unrealtournament.com/). Since opening up
the engine source code on GitHub a year ago, they've released seven
major updates that incorporate an array of contributions from the
community such as [@SRombauts](https://github.com/SRombauts)' [git
plugin](https://github.com/SRombauts/UE4GitPlugin) and much improved
Linux support.

</p>

Our latest OctoTale captured some of Epic Games' stories and some of the
amazing work that's going on in their passionate vibrant community. We
think you'll enjoy it.

And finally, some more exciting news for fans of the Unreal Engine: as
of this week, developers can enjoy [free access to Unreal Engine
4](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/ue4-is-free)!
