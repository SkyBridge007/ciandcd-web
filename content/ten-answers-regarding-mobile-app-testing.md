This white paper digs deep into the reasons testing mobile apps is
fundamentally harder than traditional web or desktop applications. A
collaboration by Tina Zhuo and Dennis Schultz from IBM along with Yoram
Mizrachi from Perfecto Mobile and John Montgomery from uTest, these
experts explore the complexities of mobile test environments, the value
of the mobile device cloud, the unique role crowd sourcing can play, and
how teams can leverage automation to help deliver quality apps.
