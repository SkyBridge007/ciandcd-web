The ThoughtWorks TAB has released the latest edition of our
<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">technology

radar</a>. As usual this provides our current view on what

technologies are interesting, generated by a mix of our technological

curiosity and project experience. Iâ€™ve also [added a
FAQ](http://martinfowler.com/articles/radar-faq.html) on my site to

answer common questions about radar, such as who on earth the

ThoughtWorks TAB is.
