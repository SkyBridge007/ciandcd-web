I’ll be taking part in a couple of [ThoughtWorks events in
Germany](http://continuous-delivery.thoughtworks.com/events/software-design-21st-century-frankfurt-berlin-2011)

during October. They are both evening events (Oct 17 Frankfurt and Oct

18 Berlin). I shall do my usual [suite of
talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html) on

some mix of topics. I’ll be joined by two of my colleagues: Wolf

Schlegel, who will be talking about continuous delivery and Erik

Dörnenburg who will be talking about using lean techniques with

enterprise architecture.
