A couple of weeks ago I dodged the historic snowstorm in New England by
heading over to San Francisco to talk at a ThoughtWorks event. As is my
habit these days I did a [suite of
talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html), covering how
and when to use schemaless data structures, why consistency in NoSQL
databases is more than just ACID versus BASE, and the economic
justification for well-designed software.
