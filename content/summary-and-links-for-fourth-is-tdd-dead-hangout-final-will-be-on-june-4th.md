I’ve added summary and links from our fourth “Is TDD Dead” podcast to my
[overview page](http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/). This
discussion looked at the downsides of testing and TDD: can you do too
much testing, and is there a problem with teams valuing tests more than
they value the functional code? We’ve set the time for [our fifth and
final
hangout](https://plus.google.com/events/cco30ri6dpkej4h4d8mejmat98o) to
be on Wednesday June 4th at 1100 Eastern time. This one will be a Q&A -
to submit and vote on questions go to the [event
page](https://plus.google.com/events/cco30ri6dpkej4h4d8mejmat98o) and
press the play button. We’ll also do some final thoughts and wrap up,
which will make this discussion run longer than we’ve done so far (maybe
going up to an hour).

ThoughtWorks has also put audio for all the episodes onto its newly
relaunched [podcast
