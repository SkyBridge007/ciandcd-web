I’m hoping to spend more time writing about [expositional
architectures](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExpositionalArchitecture.html),
systems that show interesting characteristics that will act as seeds for
ideas for other software systems. To make a start I’ve written an
infodeck describing the [SCMS-PO system of Gap
Inc](http://martinfowler.com/articles/gap-scms-po). It’s a system for
managing purchase orders with a rich javascript client talking to a java
server system using a resource API. Interesting features include using
knockout.js form of the Presentation Model pattern, a javascript
validator running on both client and server, encapsulating data access
with repositories, using MongoDB as an application database, and the
testing portfolio.
