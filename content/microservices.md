There’s been a recent growth in interest around a style of software
architecture known as “Microservices”. To help understand and explain
what all this is about I’ve teamed up with my colleague [James
Lewis](https://twitter.com/boicy), who has been an active pioneer in
this style. We’re working on writing various materials about
microservices and have [published the first installment of an
article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) that
explores the common characteristics we see in microservice architectures
and what role they can play in software systems. With this installment
we talk about how microservices think about componentization. We’ll
release further installments to explore more characteristics over the
next couple of weeks.
