The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) was coined by (Uncle) Bob
Martin several years ago. Itâ€™s a useful principle to help organize the
dependencies in your system. Here [Brett
Schuchert](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/) shows [how this principle
works in practice](http://martinfowler.com/articles/dipInTheWild.html)
to simplify designs with a couple of real world examples from his recent
ThoughtWorks projects.
