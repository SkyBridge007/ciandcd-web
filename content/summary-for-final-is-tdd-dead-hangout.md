I’ve written up the summary for the final [Is TDD
Dead](http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/) hangout. In this
episode we answered questions that viewers submitted via the Google Q&A
system. We discussed the dearth of real open-source examples of
applications and how this made it harder to examine these questions. We
looked at our experiences with TDD and the different kinds of value
we’ve drawn from it. We also examined the value of TDD to less
experienced developers. We finished by looking at TDD’s place in
software development.
