I’ve been enjoying a brief vacation in Oregon (enjoying the excellent

[Oregon Shakespeare Festival](http://www.osfashland.org/) and a nice mix
of hikes). So I’m late in

mentioning that
<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321826620">NoSQL
Distilled is now available for pre-order on

InformIT</a>. Its ship date is August 17.

</p>

If you pre-order you can get 35% off by entering discount code

FOWLER6626 during checkout (this offer expires on August 17). InformIT

is also running an offer where you get a 30 day trial to

Safari Books Online if you place an order on InformIT.

</p>

The book has now completed production and has gone off to the

printers. As I understand it the final ebook will appear when the

printed book appears on August 17. Until then Safari subscribers can

still read the [rough
cut](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780133036138), which includes the
copy-edited text, but

lacks the final layout and index.

</p>

The final book has 172 pages, which is sadly longer than we’d

hoped. We hope you’ll forgive us for that.
