I’m chuffed to see that [NoSQL
Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html) won an award today
- as a finalist in Dr Dobb’s Jolt Awards, marking it as one of their top
5 books of the year. This is the third book I’ve written that’s got this
kind of award and Pramod’s [second
award](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringDatabases.html) (but
he’s written less so has a higher average).
