Cyber attacks and data breaches of large corporations have increasingly
become more common and more frequent. No longer confined to the retail
segment, the [world’s biggest data
breaches](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)
(\>30,000 records) now touch almost all major industries, including
financial services, tech, gaming, government, healthcare, telecoms,
military, and media. It’s not uncommon for cyber attacks that access
sensitive IP to be related to blackmail and extortion threats. Data
breaches can damage a company’s brand reputation and greatly reduce
customer trust. It can also result in hundreds of millions of dollars of
damages related to reduced sales, consumer credit monitoring services
and legal fees.
