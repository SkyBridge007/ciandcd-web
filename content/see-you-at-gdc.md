The [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com) (GDC) is just a
couple of weeks away, and **we're giving away 20 expo passes so you can
get in on the fun**!

</p>

In addition to the expo itself, these passes give you access to all the
gaming goodness you can handle, including the Game Career Seminar, the
Independent Games Festival, and the Game Developers Choice Awards. For
more information, please see the [GDC passes
page](http://www.gdconf.com/attend/passes.html).

</p>

If you'd like to enter the contest, simply [fill out the following short
form](https://github.wufoo.com/forms/gdc-expo-pass-giveaway/) and tell
us about your favorite gamedev-related GitHub repository before Tuesday
February 24th 11pm PST. GitHub employees will pick their favorite 20
submissions, and the winners will be contacted via email the following
day. All winners will be responsible for their own accommodation and
transportation.
