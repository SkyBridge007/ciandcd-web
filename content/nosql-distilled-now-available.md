It’s now August 17th, and [NoSQL
Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html) is now officially
available.

My copy arrived a day or two ago, and it’s good to see it in paper.

Amazon has it available for order for physical copy. Currently they

aren’t showing it as available for Kindle, but that should change in

the next few days. InformIT is still showing a pre-order status, but

again that should change soon.

</p>

It also seems I made a mistake earlier with the page count, which
actually is

only 152 pages. So we only busted our budget by two pages after all.

(I’ve updated my [books pages](http://martinfowler.com/books) to add a
new page for this book.)
