Addison-Wesley is doing a
[promotion](http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=138302)
on books in their signature

series. This includes all the books in [my signature
series](http://martinfowler.com/books/), but also

the other signers: Kent Beck and Mike Cohn. The deal is that if you buy
two or

more signature series books from [InformIT](http://www.informit.com) you
get 40% off. The offer

is good for physical and electronic books and is on until the end of

â€‹2012. To get the discount, use the discount code AWSS2012 during

check-out. All my books pages have links to the relevant

InformIT page - they do a [good arrangement for multi-format
ebooks](http://martinfowler.com/books/buying.html).
