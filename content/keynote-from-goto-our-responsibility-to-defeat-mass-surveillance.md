[In our keynote for goto
2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNaeVQhrsyY), Erik and I consider
our responsibilities as software professionals towards combatting the
growing tide of mass surveillance. We talk about how software
professionals should take a greater role in deciding what software to
build, which requires us to have a greater knowledge of the domain and
responsibility towards our users and the greater society. We say why
privacy is important, both as a human need and [for the maintenance of a
democratic
society](http://martinfowler.com/articles/bothersome-privacy.html). We
use the example of email to explore the importance of an open,
collaborative development approach for key infrastructure, and argue our
freedoms require a greater level of encryption for all of us together
with move to decentralize. We finish with a brief mention of
“Pixelated”, a project ThoughtWorks is doing to increase the use of
encrypted email and why its challenges are much more about UX than the
details of cryptography.
