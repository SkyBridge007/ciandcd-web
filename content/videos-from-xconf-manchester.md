I gave a [suite of
talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html) at the
ThoughtWorks-organized XConf in Manchester a couple of months ago. They
have now put [videos
up](http://www.thoughtworks.com/talks/software-development-21st-century-xconf-europe-2014)
for the three talks I gave (each is around 20 minutes):

</p>

-   **Agile Essence and Fluency**: where I talk about the essential
    qualities of agile software development and the [agile fluency
    model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html) of Larsen
    and Shore
-   **Continuous Delivery:** what this technique is, its ingredients,
    how it differs from continuous deployment and its three main
    benefits
-   **Microservices:** some its common characteristics, its relationship
    with SOA, how big a microservice should be, the pros and cons of
    microservices, and the prerequisites you need to have to go live
    with them.
