Title: GitLab Reduced Merge Conflicts by 90% With Changelog Placeholders
Date: 2015-02-10 00:00
Slug: gitlab-reduced-merge-conflicts-by-90-with-changelog-placeholders

GitLab has a very active development cycle with many features being
added to its monthly release by

[more than 700 contributors](http://contributors.gitlab.com/).

Like many projects it has a

[changelog
file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG)

that details all significant new features, bugfixes and changes to
behaviour.

Every pull/merge request author is
[encouraged](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#merge-request-guidelines)

to add a line to this changelog. Unfortunately, the amount of merge
requests lead to a time-consuming problem.
