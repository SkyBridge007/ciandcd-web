Title: Speaking in Singapore

Next month (June 7) I’ll be speaking at a ThoughtWorks Quarterly
briefing in

Singapore. I’ll be doing a [suite of
talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html), one of which I

expect will be NoSQL-oriented. Also on the bill is Vivek Prahlad, a

long-term colleague at ThoughtWorks, who I’m looking forward to

catching up with. This will be the my first time in Singapore

(other than the airport).

I’m then going on to talks in China: Chengdu, Wuhan, and Xi’an.
