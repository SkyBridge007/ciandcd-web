</p>

### April 8th: The Warm Up

</p>

On Wednesday, we've lined two options for you to choose from:

</p>

If you're looking for some serious skills, sign up for **advanced Git
training** from 11am-3pm. Become a Git expert as you learn from some of
the best trainers in the world in a casual workshop setting.

</p>

If you're looking for an adventure, join your fellow Git Merge attendees
for guided tours of Paris, specially curated for you. Explore and enjoy
Parisian food and culture before the conference gets underway.

</p>

By invitation only, we will also be holding a **Git Contributors
Summit** on Wednesday for contributors and maintainers of core
implementations. Email us at <events@github.com> if you're a Git
contributor who would like to attend.

</p>

### April 9th: The Main Event

</p>

Registration will open at 9am and the main event kicks off at 10am.
We've assembled a group of speakers doing amazing things with Git, like:

</p>

-   Junio Hamano, Google
-   Rick Olson, GitHub
-   Angelos Evripiotis, Bloomberg
-   Emma Jane Hogbin Westby, author of *Git for Teams*
    </p>
    <p>
-   John Garcia, Atlassian
-   Dirk Lehmann, SAP
-   Wilhelm Bierbaum, Twitter
-   Edward Thomson, Microsoft

</p>

There will also be plenty of opportunities to discuss, learn, and
collaborate on the future of Git with everyone in attendance. And of
course we'll wrap up the evening with a **Git birthday party** that you
won't want to miss.

</p>

We hope you'll join us in Paris to celebrate 10 years of Git and the
future of things to come. [Check out the full site for more
