[Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) has
been quite the topic of conversation this year, with [a rapid rise of
interest](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=microservices&date=1%2F2012%2034m&cmpt=q).
But although this architectural style is often a useful one [it has its
challenges](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html),
which can easily lead a less experienced team into trouble. Testing is a
central part of this challenge, which is particularly relevant for those
of us that consider testing to be a central part of effective software
development.

My colleague [Toby Clemson](http://github.com/tobyclemson) has responded
to this question by [distilling his experiences into an
infodeck](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) that
explains the various testing techniques to use with microservices and
when to use them. The first installment outlines the anatomy of a
microservice architecture and explains the role of the first testing
technique: unit testing.
