Pramod and I have put together a short
[infodeck](http://martinfowler.com/articles/nosql-intro) (pdf) outlining
the reasons

why NoSQL databases are an important new dish on the software

development menu. Itâ€™s directed at non-technical managers and

customers to provide an outline of why the data world has seen this

new entrant and some direction as to the kinds of projects which

should give them a closer look.
