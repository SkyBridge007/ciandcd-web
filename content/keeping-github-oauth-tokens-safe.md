While making your source code available in a public GitHub repository is
awesome, it's important to be sure you don't accidentally commit your
passwords, secrets, or anything else that other people shouldn't know.

</p>

Starting today you can commit more confidently, knowing that we will
email you if you push one of your [OAuth Access
Tokens](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) to any public repository
with a `git push` command. As an extra bonus, we'll also revoke your
token so it can't be used to perform any unauthorized actions on your
behalf.

keys and application access tokens
