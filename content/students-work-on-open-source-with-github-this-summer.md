GitHub has been selected to participate as a mentoring organization for
[Google Summer of
Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015), a
program where students receive a stipend to contribute to open source
projects.

</p>

If you want to work with a GitHubber on an open source project, check
out our [list of project ideas](https://github.com/github/gsoc),
featuring opportunities to contribute to the [Atom
Editor](https://atom.io) and the
[Homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew) package manager for OS
X. If you have an idea for a project that we haven't suggested yet,
browse [GitHub's open source projects](https://github.com/github) and
[open a new issue on the github/gsoc
repository](https://github.com/github/gsoc/issues/new) to suggest other
ideas or ask questions about participating in the program.

</p>

Applications can be [submitted to the Google Summer of Code
website](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015)
between March 16 and March 27.
