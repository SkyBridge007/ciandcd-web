The GitHub Game Off, our very own game jam is returning next week! We've
had some [great games submitted in previous
years](https://github.com/showcases/game-off-winners) and can't wait to
see what you come up with this year.

</p>

We'll announce the theme and the details on the blog on March 13th at
9am PDT, so please stay tuned. We may even have a twist in store!

The official Twitter hashtag for the Game Off is
[`#ggo15`](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23ggo15).
