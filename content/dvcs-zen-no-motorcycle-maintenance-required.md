I’ve written previously about [why we’ve decided to birth a new
DVCS](http://www.perforce.com/blog/141212/inception-new-dvcs), so this
post is instead about its use, the Zen of it all. And with apologies to
Robert M. Pirsig[[1]](http://www.perforce.com/blog#_ftn1), I use ‘Zen’
to refer to *insight*, and specifically insight into what’s happening
when you start your first repo and work with it.
