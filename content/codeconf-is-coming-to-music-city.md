</p>

Join us in downtown Nashville on June 25 & 26 for the third installment
of the CodeConf series, where the community will come together to
continue the conversation around open source, best practices,
documentation, and collaboration at a two-day, single-track conference
at the beautiful [Bell Tower](http://thebelltower.com/).

</p>

Come to CodeConf to hear new talks from thought-provoking speakers,
connect with the open source community, and to participate in workshops
with expert instructors. Hear all the latest from GitHub and open source
project maintainers, and enjoy local food and music with developers from
all over the world.

</p>

Come with an open mind, leave a better programmer.
