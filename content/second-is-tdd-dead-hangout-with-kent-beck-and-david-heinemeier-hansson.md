We’ve sorted out the time and [link for the second part of our
hangout](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/couv627cogaue9dahj08feoa6b8)on
“Is TDD Dead”. It will be on Friday May 16 at 11:00 Eastern time. As
before the video will be posted on YouTube shortly afterwards. Again it
will be about 30 minutes long, with me playing Time Cop to shut us up.
The lead-in from last time is to discuss David’s notion of [test-induced
design
damage](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html).
David hopes to prepare an example for the base for our discussion, if so
we’ll let you know via this feed and our twitter stream so you can do
the pre-reading.
