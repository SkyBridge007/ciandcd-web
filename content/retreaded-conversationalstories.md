Here's a common misconception about agile methods. It centers on

the way user stories are created and flow through the development

activity. The misconception is that the product owner (or business

analysts) creates user stories and then put them in front of

developers to implement. The notion is that this is a flow from

product owner to development, with the product owner responsible for

determining *what* needs to be done and the developers

*how* to do it.

</p>

A justification for this approach is that this separates the

responsibilities along the lines of competence. The product owner

knows the business, what the software is for, and thus what needs to

be done. The developers know technology and know how to do things,

so they can figure out how to realize the demands of the product

owner.

</p>

This notion of product owners coming up with

[DecreedStories](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DecreedStories.html) is a
profound misunderstanding of the way

agile development should work. When we were brainstorming names at

[Snowbird](http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileStory.html), I

remember Kent suggesting "conversational". This emphasized the fact

that the heart of our thinking was of an on-going conversation

between customers and developers about how a development project

should proceed.

In terms of coming up with stories, what this means is that they

are always something to be refined through conversation - and that

developers should play an active role in helping that

definition.

</p>

-   spotting inconsistencies and gaps between the stories
-   using technical knowledge to come up with new stories that
    </p>
    <p>
    seem to fit the product owner's vision
-   seeing alternative stories that would be cheaper to build
    </p>
    <p>
    given the technological landscape
-   split stories to make them easier to plan or implement

This is the Negotiable principle in Bill Wake's
[INVEST](http://xp123.com/xplor/xp0308) test for

stories. Any member of an agile team can create stories and suggest

modifications. It may be that just a few members of a team gravitate

to writing most of the stories. That's up to the team's

self-organization as to how they want that to happen. But everyone

should be engaged in coming up and refining stories. (This

involvement is in addition to the develpers' responsibility to

estimate stories.)

</p>

The product owner does have a special responsibility. In the end

the product owner is the final decider on stories, particularly

their prioritization. This reflects the fact that the product owner

should be the best person to judge that slippery attribute of

business value. But having a final decision maker should never stop

others from participating, and should not lead people astray into a

decreed model of stories.
