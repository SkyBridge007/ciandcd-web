[Sam Newman](http://www.samnewman.org) is one of our Principal
Consultants based in London

who has been heavily involved in the development of our approaches to

[Continuous Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/delivery.html). Recently
he gave a series of QTB (Quarterly

Technology Briefing) talks and [one of these was
videoed](http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/push-the-button) and

put on the ThoughtWorks site. It’s an excellent overview of why it’s

important to learn how to do Continuous Delivery on the modern web,

together with an overview of the practices needed to achieve it.
