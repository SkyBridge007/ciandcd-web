<p>MobaXterm provides all the important&#160;<strong>remote network tools</strong>&#160;(SSH, X11, RDP, VNC, FTP, MOSH, ...) and&#160;<strong>Unix commands</strong>&#160;(bash, ls, cat, sed, grep, awk, rsync, ...) to Windows desktop, in a&#160;<strong>single portable exe file</strong>&#160;which works out of the box.&#160;<a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/features.html">More info on supported network protocols</a></p>&#13;
<p>There are many advantages of having an&#160;<strong>All-In-One network application</strong>&#160;for your remote tasks, e.g. when you use&#160;<strong>SSH</strong>&#160;to connect to a remote server, a graphical&#160;<strong>SFTP browser</strong>&#160;will automatically pop up in order to directly edit your remote files. Your remote applications will also display seamlessly on your Windows desktop using the embedded&#160;<strong>X server</strong>.&#160;<a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/demo.html">See demo</a></p>&#13;
