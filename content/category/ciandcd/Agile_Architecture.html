    Agile Architecture</title></head><body><div><p>











Rethink featured three talks, examining the last 13 years and what's evolved since the Agile Manifesto was published.
[MUSIC PLAYING] The word "agile" is actually an adjective. [LAUGHING] You can't sell adjectives. You can only sell nouns. So the first thing that we had to do was totally corrupt the English language and to put "agile" from being an adjective into a noun. When you think about Agile, there is usually some sort of plan. The benefit is that it can change. I value building cathedrals more than I value cutting stone, and I think a lot of this is driven is around the notion that we, as software professionals, have taken a lot of craft back, but we still haven't gotten to the point where we're building cathedrals. With our Agile approach, what you're doing instead is you're trying to break down by pieces of functionality. Let's build a little piece of the system over the course of these days on the most valuable product in the thinnest slice that we can. But we're basically breaking it down by complete slices. I'm calling it food that way. Now, an interesting tie-in down here is, well, how does this lie with the notion of this kind of architecture thing? You cannot do good architecture without programming, and you cannot do good programming without thinking about architecture. [MUSIC PLAYING]
