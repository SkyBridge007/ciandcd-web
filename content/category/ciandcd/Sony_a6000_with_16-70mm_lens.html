    Sony a6000 with 16-70mm lens</title></head><body><div><p>There's been a steady rise of mirrorless cameras in the last
    few years. It seems all the cool kids have been getting into the
    Fuji X series. Although I'm not that concerned with camera gear, I
    have been keeping an eye on this trend myself - although I'm happy
    with most aspects of my current Canon DSLR system, there is one area where
    it comes up short - or rather comes up heavy, since the
    problematic aspect is weight.</p>

<p>My first serious digital camera was the <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A1/A1A.HTM">Minolta A1</a>.
    It was primitive by modern standards, small sensor, fixed lens,
    but it weighed in at 650g. That meant that it was easy to carry
    around, usually in a case that I threaded onto my belt. When it
    died and I got my first Canon DLSR, the increased weight meant
    that I now needed a special camera belt to carry it around on.
    Although the Canon was a much better camera, I missed the weight
    of the A1.</p>

<p>So I've been watching the mirrorless scene, keeping an eye out
    for my neo-A1. The Fujis have got very close, but a vital element
    in the camera body is a tilting LCD display. Although I use the
    viewfinder most of the time, I do find it valuable to use a
    tilting display when I want to shoot at different angles: low
    down, overhead, or to get the right angle on a flower. The
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FPKDRVY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FPKDRVY">rangefinder format Fujis</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt=""> didn't have a tilting screen (or lacked a
    viewfinder). The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HYAL88W?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00HYAL88W">XT-1</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt=""> does, but it then broke my weight limit.</p>

<p>Although a lot of photo-blog concentrates on the Fujis, they
    aren't the only mirrorless game in town. The micro 4/3 cameras
    have been around for a while, but I didn't fancy reducing the
    sensor size. About a year ago a friend showed me his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096W1OKS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0096W1OKS">Sony NEX-6</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">. It seemed to hit all the
    right buttons for me, but it didn't have a lens that was right for
    me. I didn't like the power zoom on the kit lens - I wanted a good
    quality normal range zoom, something cose to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NEGTTM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002NEGTTM">15-85mm</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt=""> that spends most time on <a href="/bliki/Canon60D.html">my
    Canon 60D</a>.</p>

<p>So the appearance of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENZRPG0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00ENZRPG0">Sony-Zeiss

    attractive. I waited for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8BICCG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00I8BICCG">Sony a6000

    Apple's raw processing and then went and bought the package. I've
    now used the combo for a few months, so can make an informal
    review.</p>

(While the
      other photos in the article were taken with this camera, I used
      my iPhone and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JNRW950?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00JNRW950">nova</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt=""> for this one.)</p>
<p>Number one question for me, is the ergonomics - how much do I
    enjoy using it? My answer is "a lot". The weight is back down to
    the A1 levels, so I got a case that will thread onto my belt and a
    wrist strap. The whole setup is much more fun and convenient, the
    camera is out of the way until I need it, and I can get to it
    quickly when I do. The lens zooms smoothly and covers my common
    shooting range, and the lens balances really well with the camera.
    The camera controls are very customizable, you can assign most
    functions to any button, and I've found a setup that works well
    for me. The electronic viewfinder is big and bright, indeed my
    Canon's viewfinder now feels small when I use it. I particularly
    like the fact that I can set the electronic viewfinder to show
    subtle zebra stripes on over-exposed highlights, which means I
    don't need to chimp to check highlights any more.</p>

<p>A lot of people like the Fuji's retro controls: aperture dial
    on the lens, dedicated shutter speed and ISO dials. Although they
    appeal to my nostalgia, I suspect the mode dial approach of the
    Sony works better for me. There are times when I like being able to switch quickly
    from shooting a landscape (aperture priority at f8) to shooting
    people (shutter speed at 1/250), and being able to do that with a
    single click of the mode dial is very handy. (The Sony also has the
    ability to save settings in presets, but I haven't felt the need
    to figure that out yet.)</p>

<p>So how about image quality? I worry less about a camera's image
    quality then many people seem to. I consider that the quality of
    your camera is, at best, third on the list of factors of getting a
    good photograph. <a href="#footnote-quality">[1]</a> And realistically, any
    camera I'm likely to buy is going to be a better camera than I am
    a photographer. Having said that I'm not noticing any reduction in
    quality compared to my Canon setup. In fact I've noticed a couple
    of things looking better. The rendering of clouds in some
    situations is strikingly nice. I also think I'm able to dig out
    more detail in over and under exposed areas of the RAW files,
    giving me more flexibility when tweaking the exposure in
    post-processing.</p>

<p>So all in all, I'm very happy with the purchase. It's now my
    principal serious camera, and will be my usual choice for future trips.</p>

<p>I'm not yet at the point of getting more lenses for the Sony.
    There are a few that have some appeal. There is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B20OYUO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00B20OYUO">nice prime pancake lens</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">, which would
    allow me to pop the camera in a jacket pocket. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096W1ONK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0096W1ONK">Super-wide</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt=""> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNJWSDS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00HNJWSDS">tele

    so committed to the Sony system yet that I want to invest in many
    more lenses.</p>

<p>One lens I would most want is the equivalent to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009USVW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00009USVW">Canon 100mm f2</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">, which I find really
    handy for my informal portraiture. If I could really stretch out
    my wish list, I'd like some way to link the camera to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JNRW950?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00JNRW950">Nova flash unit</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">. The Nova is such a
    convenient flash to carry around, it would be lovely to use it with
    cameras other than the iPhone.</p>

<p>Most of the time, I prefer using the Sony, but there are cases
    where the Canon still has an edge. I enjoy taking informal
    portraits of my colleagues during meetings, here I find the Sony
    is a little slower to be ready to shoot, only a second or so, but
    that's significant when you want to get someone laughing. I also
    think the Canon would be better for wildlife or sports - although
    I rarely do those. I still have flash gear and more lenses for the
    Canon, and if I'm not concerned about weight I'm happy to keep
    using it.</p>

<p>But generally I would recommend this combination. If you have
    an SLR and are looking for less weight, then it certainly fit the
    bill for me. If you're looking to get into serious cameras then,
    unless you are expecting to do wildlife or sports, I would
    recommend going mirrorless, and this is a fine option.</p>
