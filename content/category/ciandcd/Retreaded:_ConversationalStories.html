<p>Here's a common misconception about agile methods. It centers on
  the way user stories are created and flow through the development
  activity. The misconception is that the product owner (or business
  analysts) creates user stories and then put them in front of
  developers to implement. The notion is that this is a flow from
  product owner to development, with the product owner responsible for
  determining <i>what</i> needs to be done and the developers
  <i>how</i> to do it.</p>

<p>A justification for this approach is that this separates the
  responsibilities along the lines of competence. The product owner
  knows the business, what the software is for, and thus what needs to
  be done. The developers know technology and know how to do things,
  so they can figure out how to realize the demands of the product
  owner.</p>

<p>This notion of product owners coming up with
  <a href="DecreedStories.html">DecreedStories</a> is a profound misunderstanding of the way
  agile development should work. When we were brainstorming names at
  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileStory.html">Snowbird</a>, I
  remember Kent suggesting "conversational". This emphasized the fact
  that the heart of our thinking was of an on-going conversation
  between customers and developers about how a development project
  should proceed.</p>
<img src="images/conversationalStories/conversation.png">
<p>In terms of coming up with stories, what this means is that they
  are always something to be refined through conversation - and that
  developers should play an active role in helping that
  definition.</p>

<ul>
<li>spotting inconsistencies and gaps between the stories</li>

<li>using technical knowledge to come up with new stories that
    seem to fit the product owner's vision</li>

<li>seeing alternative stories that would be cheaper to build
    given the technological landscape</li>

<li>split stories to make them easier to plan or implement</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the Negotiable principle in Bill Wake's <a href="http://xp123.com/xplor/xp0308">INVEST</a> test for
  stories. Any member of an agile team can create stories and suggest
  modifications. It may be that just a few members of a team gravitate
  to writing most of the stories. That's up to the team's
  self-organization as to how they want that to happen. But everyone
  should be engaged in coming up and refining stories. (This
  involvement is in addition to the develpers' responsibility to
  estimate stories.)</p>

<p>The product owner does have a special responsibility. In the end
  the product owner is the final decider on stories, particularly
  their prioritization. This reflects the fact that the product owner
  should be the best person to judge that slippery attribute of
  business value. But having a final decision maker should never stop
  others from participating, and should not lead people astray into a
  decreed model of stories.</p>
