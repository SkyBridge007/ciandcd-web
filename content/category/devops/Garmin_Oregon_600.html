    Garmin Oregon 600</title></head><body><div><p>Not long ago, a GPS unit (I rather like the British word
    "satnav") that you carry around when hiking, was a geeky item for
    gadget freaks. These days, most fairly well-off people carry a
    smart phone with that capability and take it for granted, so much
    so that it's reasonable to wonder if there's any value left in a
    dedicated handheld satnav. I still rather like having one, I use
    it either when hiking, or mounted on my handlebars when cycling. I
    prefer it because it's more rugged in poor weather, and also using
    the GPS won't drain my phone battery. For the last few years I've
    used the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSOXTO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000CSOXTO">Garmin 60CSx</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">. It's a
    nice unit, but my device has a worsening fault with it freezing on
    startup. <a href="#footnote-60-fault">[1]</a></p>

<p>So I fancied getting something new, and I settled on the
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AXUXRUC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00AXUXRUC">Garmin
    Oregon 600</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">. So far I haven't had a chance to use it on the bike,
    and the winter means I won't get such a chance for several more
    months. But I did take it for a few days hiking in Switzerland,
    and thought I'd share my experiences.</p>

<p>The Oregon has a touch screen, rather than the dedicated
    buttons of the 60CSx. I was a bit concerned about that, since when I
    bought the 60CSx I also looked at the Oregon of the time and
    concluded that the screen wasn't bright enough. But things have
    improved a lot over the few years since, and the screen looks
    lovely and bright now. The touch screen generally makes it easier
    to operate. I have some concern about what I'll do in the winter
    when I have gloves on, but we don't do much winter hiking, so I
    think we'll not be too worried about it.</p>

<p>The Oregon comes in several variants. I bought the basic 600
    model. There's also a 650, which adds a built in camera. Since
    I'll have my smart phone with me, and usually a more serious
    camera, I didn't feel that was worthwhile. The other variation in
    the line is the 600t (and 650t) which adds a complete set of topo
    maps for the USA, but these are worthless as I'll elaborate on
    later.</p>

<p>For our hiking trip I found the Oregon 600 worked out really
    well. The unit fits nicely in the hand, and the display is bright
    and clear. The touch screen makes using the map display much
    easier, with the usual pan and pinch operations that we're used to
    with smartphones. I found the battery life to be excellent, a pair
    of rechargeable batteries easily lasted for a couple of days
    hiking.</p>

<p>The unit is extremely customizable, with every slot on the UI
    customizable to a particular application or screen within an
    application. This can be a bit of a problem, as you can invest a
    lot of time setting up the unit to way you'd like it to work (and
    it's confusing should you accidentally remove a key application
    from the main screen, can't figure out how to get the unit to find
    locations, and have to resort to googling the web to find you need
    to dig the application out from setup menus). A nice feature is
    that you can save your customizations for different modes of use -
    so I can have one set of customizations for hiking and another for
    biking. This looks very useful, although I haven't tried switching
    modes yet. </p>

<p>The accuracy of the unit seems pretty good. I tend to treat a
    satnav as unit to use in combination with map and compass, and I
    don't do things like geocaching, so I'm more tolerant of lower
    accuracy than some would be. But it seemed to track our hiking
    well. That said, we tended to be in open country, not in woods, or
    in canyons that are a challenge for a satnav.</p>

<p>The great plus on modern satnavs is how they work with maps,
    and when it comes to maps and Garmin there is both bad news and
    good news. For biking with the 60CSx I bought a set of Garmin's
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWX54?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=martinfowlerc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003FXWX54">routable
    street maps for North America</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=martinfowlerc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="">. This allowed me to plot a route out on my
    computer before the ride and then follow it, an approach which
    works really well for me. But the Garmin maps are locked to a
    single physical device, so I can't transfer them from my now
    defunct 60CSx to my new Oregon. This is ludicrous, it actually acts
    as a disincentive for upgrading a Garmin unit, and means there's
    little incentive to stay within the Garmin brand. If you've
    invested money in maps, it's very frustrating to not be able to
    use them with another device, particularly when maps are so easily
    available for free on your smartphone <a href="#footnote-maps-provider">[2]</a>. Indeed this, plus my annoyance with the startup
    fault on the 60CSx, were reasons to move away from Garmin when I
    wanted to replace the unit.</p>

<p>But there's good news on the maps front - a vibrant ecosystem
    of open-source maps (see below for links). I had discovered
    these with the 60CSx, which is why I'd never bothered with buying
    topo maps (and why the "t" units are a waste of money). I'd
    downloaded excellent topo maps for hiking trips in the US and
    Europe. There are also routable street maps based on open street
    maps, although I don't yet know how well they will work for me
    until spring gets us back on our saddles. But at least for the
    swiss trip, I found <a href="http://download.freizeitkarte-osm.de/garmin/latest/CHE_de_gmapsupp.img.zip">excellent
    open source maps</a> that I could easily install and use. And I
    appreciate that, unlike the 60CSx, the Oregon allows me to easily
    switch between different map images without faffing around with
    the file system on the micro SD card. Garmin's <a href="http://www.garmin.com/en-US/shop/downloads/basecamp">BaseCamp
    application</a>  &#8212; for working with maps, waypoints, and tracks &#8212; has
    steadily improved over the years on the mac. I use it both for
    pre-planning routes and waypoints and also for looking at tracks
    when we're done.</p>

<p>All in all, I like my upgrade. The Oregon 600 is all in all a
    better experience to work with than the old one. If you're
    considering a dedicated hand-held satnav, then this is a good
    choice (with the proviso that I'm only basing it on a single
    hiking trip so far.)</p>
