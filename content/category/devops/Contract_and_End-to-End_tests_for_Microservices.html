<p class="abstract">
        There has been a shift in service based architectures over the last few
        years towards smaller, more focussed "micro" services. There are many
        benefits with this approach such as the ability to independently
        deploy, scale and maintain each component and
        parallelize development across multiple teams. However,
        once these additional network partitions have been introduced, the
        testing strategies that applied for monolithic in process applications
        need to be reconsidered.
