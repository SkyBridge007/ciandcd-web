    Videos from XConf Manchester</title></head><body><div><p>I'm an author, speaker&#8230; essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development. I've been working in the software industry since the mid-'80s where I got into the then-new world of object-oriented software. I got a call from ThoughtWorks in 1999 to consult on one of their projects and they rapidly became my favorite client. Within a year I was an employee.</p>

<p>My main interest is to understand how to design software systems, so as to maximize the productivity of development teams. In doing this I&#8217;ve looked to understand the patterns of good software design, and also the processes that support software design. I learn a lot from listening to the experiences of my fellow ThoughtWorkers: digging for useful ideas and communicating them to the wider world.</p>
