<p>When applying permissions to directories on Linux, the permission bits have different meanings than on regular files.</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>The write bit allows the affected user to create, rename, or delete files within the directory, and modify the directory&#8217;s attributes</li>&#13;
<li>The read bit allows the affected user to list the files within the directory</li>&#13;
<li>The execute bit allows the affected user to enter the directory, and access files and directories inside</li>&#13;
<li>The sticky bit states that files and directories within that directory may only be deleted or renamed by their owner (or root)</li>&#13;
</ul></div></body></html>
