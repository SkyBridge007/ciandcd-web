It inspired me to write about it from an employee&#8217;s perspective.</p>

<p>I started working with GitLab 2 months ago and it has been quite an interesting experience to work remotely with a team that&#8217;s spread out in the world.</p>

 


<p>I have been working from home for a while, with freelance jobs, but it was very different to today, that I am part of a remote team. Here are the highlights of my experience so far:</p>

<h2>Learning how to communicate</h2>

<p>It was hard at the beginning to communicate with my team. I hadn&#8217;t met them in person and if I had a doubt about something, I had to go to Slack to find the person who seemed the nicest and ask him. I was shy to write people to ask for their help all the time, but I learned that it is &#8220;the way&#8221; to learn and to stay communicated in a remote job. I learned not to be afraid to ask and to provide as much context as I could, trying not to include so many links without information.</p>

<h2>Avoiding interruptions</h2>

<p>So it is great to have coworkers and being with people, but they usually talk with each other, they are friendly and they get you distracted. I love working from home. I got myself nice headphones and I wear them when I don&#8217;t want anybody at home to distract me. I think I can focus more and get into my &#8220;zone&#8221; easier.</p>

<h2>Morning calls in my PJs</h2>

<p>The first few days I would wake up really early to look fresh and dressed up for my morning call with the team. Then, I realized that Hangouts won&#8217;t show the difference, so I learned to wake up, fix some coffee, sit down and work in my PJs all morning and then have a late shower during a brake. It is absolutely comfortable and fun, but it&#8217;s important to learn to be disciplined. No matter how you look or if you are in bed, you need to get into the mindset of working and have a disciplined productive day.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s all about trust before they can see results</h2>

<p>Trust is a strong word and for me, it is what I feel about having a remote job. They trust that I work and that I use my time wisely. I have been learning to be more efficient, but since GitLab is very technical and I&#8217;ve had to learn so much, my speed has been very slowly increasing. I believe they trust that I am putting all my efforts into my job and that even though nobody is next to me looking at me working, I am doing my job. That makes me work more because when somebody trusts you, you don&#8217;t want to disappoint them</p>

<h2>Find a comfortable place where you can be productive</h2>

<p>I have been traveling for a couple of years and when I started, I would just try to find a comfortable  and cheap place to stay at, close to a yoga studio. Now, I find myself looking for an Airbnb with a good wifi connection and a comfortable desk or table. The rest is second. This is very important for my mental and physical health and I believe it&#8217;s one of the most important things to make sure you have. If I can&#8217;t find this, I will look for a co-working space or a working cafe. It is important to be able to sit comfortably and stay connected with no distractions.</p>

<h2>I am able to travel</h2>

<p>This is my favorite highlight. I used to work in the traditional corporate world, which helped me save some money and start traveling with it. When I was running out of savings, I thought that my travels had to end soon. The fact that I could work remotely was one for the best things that could happen to me, since it allows me to work from anywhere and to see the world. I can also spend quality time with my dog and it lets me take care of her.</p>

<p>So, are you thinking about applying for a remote job? Do it! It&#8217;s awesome!</p>
