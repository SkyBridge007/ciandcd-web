<p align="center"><em><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/devops-security-forrester-webinar%282%29.png"></em></p>
<p>The advantages of DevOps and Continuous Delivery have been much touted the last several years: faster application delivery, better product quality, cost savings&#8230; the list goes on. What have gotten less attention are the security risks these new practices can place on your intellectual property.</p>
<p>Engineering and Operations teams need to understand these security implications. Similarly, Security teams need to better understand modern release practices. Above all, these teams need to work better together.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re hosting a <a href="http://info.perforce.com/webinar-overview-security-devops.html">webinar</a>&#160;featuring two principal analysts from Forrester Research who come at this issue from different vantage points. <strong>Kurt Bittner</strong> focuses on application development and delivery, while <strong>Rick Holland</strong> focuses on security and risk.</p>
<p>During our&#160;webinar, Kurt and Rick will share&#8230;</p>
<ul><li>Perspectives on how modern product delivery practices introduce additional security threats to intellectual property</li>
	<li>Insights on how DevOps and Security teams can work better together</li>
	<li>Best practices for bringing greater security to product development and delivery</li>
</ul><p>So here it is&#8230; a great opportunity to get your Engineering, DevOps and Security teams on the same page. Book a conference room together. Jointly decide what questions to ask during the live Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you on our webinar!</p>
