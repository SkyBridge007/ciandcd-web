Last fall [goto Aarhus](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012) continued its
ongoing interest in new approaches to data with a track gathering
together various experiences with [NoSQL
databases](http://martinfowler.com/nosql.html). I was asked to kick off
this track with an introductory talk for an hour giving an outline to
the important issues in thinking about NoSQL. I talk about the origins
of NoSQL, forms of NoSQL data models, the way many NoSQL databases
consider the problem of consistency, and the importance of Polyglot
Persistence. I was pretty happy with how this turned out and think it’s
a good way to spend an hour if you want to start a journey in
understanding NoSQL.

There is also a video of a [panel of NoSQL
vendors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=191kCkNya5Q&list=PLEx5khR4g7PJmH05qNUmmo8WzSSaJIzLj&index=7)
that I participated on. This wasn’t a great discussion - lots of talking
past each other, but maybe worth a look for people who are already into
the NoSQL world.
