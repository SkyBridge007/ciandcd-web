InformIT now has ebooks available, so this means that [NoSQL
Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html)

is now available in all ebook formats. As all the formats get

complicated, I’ve written a
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/buying.html">brief note on some
options for buying

paper and electronic books</a>.

</p>

Some people have asked about when the paper books will reach other

countries, including Amazon’s non-US stores. I’m afraid I have no

information on that.
