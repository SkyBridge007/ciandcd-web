Morrisons OrderPad is a tablet web-application that helps staff in
supermarkets place orders for new stock as they walk around the store.
My colleague Rob Miles and I felt that the resulting application makes a
good expositional architecture for a tablet web application backed by a
lightweight java server. We highlight the separation of application
control and DOM interaction on the client, using small, focused
frameworks on the server, the broad-stack testing environment, and the
use of a pilot project to understand what features were needed.
