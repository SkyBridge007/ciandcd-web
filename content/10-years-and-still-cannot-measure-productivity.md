Title: 10 years and still Cannot Measure Productivity

One of the great frustrations of the software industry is that we donâ€™t
have properly built studies to figure out whether development tools and
techniques such as object-oriented programming, test-driven development,
or even high-level languages are good for us. Regularly we see
improperly built studies that do so - often these are done poorly
because they rely on a bogus measure of productivity (such as Lines of
Code per staff day). 10 years ago today, my frustration led me to
publish my bliki post
[CannotMeasureProductivity](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html).
I think this post is sadly just as sound today as it was a decade ago.
