Iâ€™ve added two more examples of collection pipelines with [this second
installment](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/#ExploringMorePipelinesAndOperations).
The first is the classic combination of map and reduce, also introducing
specifying functions with names as well as lambdas. The second
introduces the group-by operation and treating hashmaps as key-value
pairs.
