I've often been involved in discussions about deliberately

increasing the diversity of a group of people. The most common case

in software is increasing the proportion of women. Two examples are

in hiring and conference speaker rosters where we discuss trying to

get the proportion of women to some level that's higher than usual.

A common argument against pushing for greater diversity is that it

will lower standards, raising the spectre of a diverse but mediocre

group.

</p>

To understand why this is an illusionary concern, I like to

consider a little thought experiment. Imagine a giant bucket that

contains a hundred thousand marbles. You know that 10% of these

marbles have a special sparkle that you can see when you carefully

examine them. You also know that 80% of these marbles are blue and

20% pink, and that sparkles exist evenly across both colors
[[1]](http://martinfowler.com/feed.atom#footnote-sparkle). If you were

asked to pick out ten sparkly marbles, you know you could

confidently go through some and pick them out. So now imagine you're

told to pick out ten marbles such that five were blue and five were

pink.

</p>

I don't think you would react by saying “that's impossible”.

After all there are two thousand pink sparkly marbles in there,

getting five of them is not beyond the wit of even a man. Similarly

in software, there may be less women in the software business, but

there are still enough good women to fit the roles a company or a

conference needs.

</p>

The point of the marbles analogy, however, is to focus on the

real consequence of the demand for 50:50 split. Yes it's possible to

find the appropriate marbles, but the downside is that it takes

longer. [[2]](http://martinfowler.com/feed.atom#footnote-non-binary)

</p>

That notion applies to finding the right people too. Getting

a better than base proportion of women isn't impossible, but it does

require more work, often much more work. This extra effort

reinforces the rarity, if people have difficulty finding good

people as it is, it needs determined effort to spend the extra time

to get a higher proportion of the minority group — even if you are

only trying to raise the proportion of women up to 30%, rather than

a full 50%.

</p>

In recent years we've made increasing our diversity a high

priority at ThoughtWorks. This has led to a lot of effort trying to

go to where we are more likely to run into the talented women we are

seeking: women's colleges, women-in-IT groups and conferences. We

encourage our women to speak at conferences, which helps let other

women know we value a diverse workforce.

</p>

When interviewing, we make a point of ensuring there are women

involved. This gives women candidates someone to relate to, and

someone to ask questions which are often difficult to ask men. It's

also vital to have women interview men, since we've found that women

often spot problematic behaviors that men miss as we just don't have

the experiences of subtle discriminations. Getting a diverse group

of people inside the company isn't just a matter of recruiting, it

also means paying a lot of attention to the environment we have, to try
to

ensure we don't have the same
[AlienatingAtmosphere](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AlienatingAtmosphere.html)
that

much of the industry exhibits.
[[3]](http://martinfowler.com/feed.atom#footnote-client-atmosphere)

</p>

One argument I've heard against this approach is that if everyone

did this, then we would run out of pink, sparkly marbles. We'll know

this is something to be worried about when women are paid

significantly more than men for the same work.

</p>

One anecdote that stuck in my memory was from a large,

traditional company who wanted to improve the number of women in

senior management positions. They didn't impose a quota on

appointing women to those positions, but they did impose a quota for

women on the list of candidates. (Something like: "there must be at

least three credible women candidates for each post".) This

candidate quota forced the company to actively seek out women

candidates. The interesting point was that just doing this, with no

mandate to actually appoint these women, correlated with an increased

proportion of women in those positions.

</p>

For conference planning it's a similar strategy: just putting out a call
for

papers and saying you'd like a diverse speaker lineup isn't enough.

Neither are such things as blind review of proposals (and I'm not

sure that's a good idea anyway). The important thing is to seek out

women and encourage them to submit ideas. Organizing conferences is

hard enough work as it is, so I can sympathize with those that don't

want to add to the workload, but those that do can get there.
<a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/09/how-we-got-40-female-speakers-at-flowcon/">FlowCon

is a good example</a> of a conference that made this an explicit

goal and did far better than the industry average (and in case you

were wondering, there was
<a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2013/12/flowcon-2013-wrap-up/">no

difference between men's and women's evaluation scores</a>).

</p>

So now that we recognize that getting greater diversity is a

matter of application and effort, we can ask ourselves whether the

benefit is worth the cost. In a broad professional sense, I've

argued that it is, because our
[DiversityImbalance](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DiversityImbalance.html)
is

reducing our ability to bring the talent we need into our profession,

and reducing the influence our profession needs to have on society.

In addition I believe there is a moral argument to push back against

long-standing wrongs faced by

[HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/HistoricallyDiscriminatedAgainst.html)
groups.

</p>

Conferences have an important role to play in correcting this

imbalance. The roster of speakers is, at least subconsciously, a

statement of what the profession should look like. If it's all white

guys like me, then that adds to the
[AlienatingAtmosphere](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AlienatingAtmosphere.html)

that pushes women out of the profession. Therefore I believe that

conferences need to strive to get an increased proportion of

historically-discriminated-against speakers. We, as a profession,

need to push them to do this. It also means that women have an

extra burden to become visible and act as part of that better

direction for us.

</p>

For companies, the choice is more personal. For me,

ThoughtWorks's efforts to improve its diversity are a major factor

in why I've been an employee here for over a decade. I don't think

it's a coincidence that ThoughtWorks is also a company that has a

greater open-mindedness, and a lack of political maneuvering, than most
of the

companies I've consulted with over the years. I consider those

attributes to be a considerable competitive advantage in attracting

talented people, and providing an environment where we can

collaborate effectively to do our work.

</p>

But I'm not holding ThoughtWorks up as an example of perfection.

We've made a lot of progress over the decade I've been here, but we

still have a long way to go. In particular we are very short of

senior technical women. We've introduced a number of programs around

networks, and leadership development, to help grow women

to fill those gaps. But these things take time - all you have to do

is look at our [Technical Advisory
Board](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq)

to see that we are a long way from the ratio we seek.

</p>

Despite my knowledge of how far we still have to climb, I can

glimpse the summit ahead. At a recent AwayDay in Atlanta I was

delighted to see how many younger technical women we've managed to

bring into the company. While struggling to keep my head above water

as the sole male during a late night game of
[Dominion](http://martinfowler.com/articles/eurogames/), I enjoyed a

great feeling of hope for our future.

That is 10% of blue marbles are sparkly as are 10% of pink.

Actually, if I dig around for a while in that bucket, I find

that some marbles are neither blue nor pink, but some

engaging mixture of the two.

This is especially tricky for a company like us, where so much

of our work is done in client environments, where we aren't able

to exert as much of an influence as we'd like. Some of our

offices have put together special training to educate both sexes

on how to deal with sexist situations with clients. As a man, I

feel it's important for me to know how I can be supportive, it's

not something I do well, but it is something I want to learn to improve.

Many people find the pressure of public speaking intimidating

(I've come to hate it, even with all my practice). Feeling that

you're representing your entire gender or race only makes it

worse.
