I recently bought a [Garmin Oregon
600](http://martinfowler.com/articles/garmin-oregon-600.html) handheld
satnav (GPS) and took it on a vacation, hiking in Switzerland. I find it
fun to use, a worthwhile upgrade on my earlier Garmin 60 CSx. It has a
bright, clear screen, good battery life, and you can easily find decent
open-source topo maps to put on it.
