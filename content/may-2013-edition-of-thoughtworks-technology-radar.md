The [ThoughtWorks Technology Advisory Board
(TAB)](http://martinfowler.com/articles/radar-faq.html#tab) has released
the latest edition of our [technology
radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). This is where we highlight
some of the technologies that are currently attracting our attention and
that we feel are worth you taking a look at. In this edition our themes
include my long term interest in breaking down boundaries between people
and groups, lightweight option for analytics, infrastructure as code,
and applying the practices that have worked well for us in development
to places that are missing them.
