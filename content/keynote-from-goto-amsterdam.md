Title: Keynote from Goto Amsterdam

Slug: keynote-from-goto-amsterdam

Earlier this year I gave a keynote at the Goto conference in Amsterdam.
It’s now up on YouTube. As usual it follows my ‘Software Design in the
21st Century’ template with a pair of short talks. I begin with talking
about [**Schemaless data
structures**](http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless), explaining
why there is always an implicit schema and the consequences of that.
Second up I talk about the [**essence of agile** software
development](http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html) and
the [**agile fluency**
model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html).
