My colleague Ian Cartwright has contributed a short write-up of a

week-long proof-of-concept project we did with AutoTrader to assess

the viability of using Googleâ€™s BigQuery technology. The software

produced 7-10 second response times for a dataset of 750 million rows.

The article describes what they did and summarizes the lessons they

learned from the experience.
