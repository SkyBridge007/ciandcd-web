[Toby Clemson](http://github.com/tobyclemson) finishes his guide to
[techniques for testing
microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/).
He adds two more classes of testing: [contract
tests](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#testing-contract-introduction)
test the interface contract of a microservice, [end-to-end
tests](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#testing-component-introduction)
verify the whole system - but are prone to many difficulties. He
concludes by looking at how these various kinds of tests should be
[assembled into an effective test
portfolio](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#conclusion-test-pyramid).
