Title: Five years of Flaccid Scrum

Five years ago, I wrote [this
post](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html) to highlight a
particular problem we’d been seeing with project teams using Scrum but
neglecting the technical practices you need for successful software
development. I’m reposting it now as the problem is still with us,
indeed it seems more common as Scrum and agile has become more popular.
My advice still stands - ensure you take technical practices seriously
when introducing Scrum (or indeed any agile approach).
