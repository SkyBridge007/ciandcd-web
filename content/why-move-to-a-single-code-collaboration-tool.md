Say your department has five teams, and each team is running its own
code collaboration tool.

One of the teams is still using SVN.

Other teams have moved on to a Distributed Version Control Solution
(DVCS), but the teams all use different solutions.

</p>

All the developers are happy at this time.

They get to use their own workflow, the one they prefer.

The team leads get to manage tools that they are already comfortable
with.

You don't have to deal with people complaining that their tool sucks.

</p>

But underneath all that happiness, trouble slowly brews.
