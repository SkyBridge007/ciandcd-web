Title: Reference pages for DSL patterns

Slug: reference-pages-for-dsl-patterns

I’ve been very tardy in doing this, but I’ve finally put up a set of

reference pages for the patterns in the [DSL
Book](http://martinfowler.com/books/dsl.html). There’s not much

on each page, just the intent, chapter reference, and sometimes some

summary text. I’ve primarily put these up to give them a stable URI

for reference purposes. There’s a chance I’ll put supplemental

material up there too, but I’ve had that intention before without

anything happening.
