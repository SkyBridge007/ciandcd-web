Short daily “stand-up” meetings are a regular feature of agile projects.
Done

signal to noise ratio. Done badly, they can be pretty grim. For

several years, this article by Jason Yip has become the definitive

finished a

comprehensive revision of the article, so if you’re looking to get the

best from your stand-ups, you should take a good look at the tips in
