Iâ€™ll be joining my colleague Jez Humble to give another of our

tutorials on Continuous Delivery at [goto;
Aarhus](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/presentations/show_presentation.jsp?oid=3172).
This is the

rebranded incarnation of JAOO - which has been my favorite conference
for a long time now. This will be our first time doing the full day
continuous delivery tutorial in Aarhus.
