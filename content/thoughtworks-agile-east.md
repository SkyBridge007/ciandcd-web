ThoughtWorks is organizing an [Agile
East](http://www.thoughtworks.com/events/spend-day-martin-fowler-neal-ford-other-agile-thought-leaders)
event: a one day

conference that we’re holding in New York (November 2) and Atlanta

(November 7). I’ll be speaking, doing my usual
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html">suite of

talks</a>. More importantly there’s an impressive line up of my

colleagues - the people whose ideas I clip and package up into those

talks. So this is a great opportunity to listen to:

</p>

-   Graham and Andy talk from their experiences in the
    </p>
    <p>
    technical leadership of agile projects
-   project management lessons from Joe Z
-   hot devops and continuous delivery juice from Rolf and Jez
-   Ross’s advice on IT budgeting
-   Linda’s take on integrating UX with an agile project
-   Matt on using offshore teams for agile (he played a big role
    </p>
    <p>
    in building our offshore teams)
-   a trio of talks on the gnarly topic of organizational change from
    Tiffany, Greg and Manu
-   Chad explaining how to avoid the pitfalls of automated tests

</p>

and a special guest in New York who will make all our

talks seem pedestrian.
