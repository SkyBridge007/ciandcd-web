In this second installment [Mike
Bland](https://plus.google.com/+MikeBland/posts) takes [a look at the
Heartbleed bug](http://martinfowler.com/articles/testing-culture.html),
showing what kind of unit tests would expose the bug and the testing
culture that would encourage these tests to be written. He further
stresses that a testing culture wouldn’t consider a bug to be fixed
without additional tests and posits a corollary to Linus’s Law.
