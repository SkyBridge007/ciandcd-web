Our keynote at QCon London 2012 looks at the role data is playing in

our lives (and that it’s doing more than just getting bigger).

</p>

-   How the world of data is changing: its
    </p>
    <p>
    growing, becoming more distributed and connected.
-   The industry’s response: the rise of NoSQL, the shift to service

    </p>
    integration, the appearance of event sourcing, the impact of clouds

    <p>
    and new analytics with a greater role for visualization.

-   How data is being used now, with a particular emphasis from Rebecca
    on
    </p>
    <p>
    data in the developing world.
-   What does all this
    </p>
    <p>
    mean to our personal responsibilities as software professionals.
