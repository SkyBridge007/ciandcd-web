Although I do my best to limit my public speaking, I do have a fond spot
for the [goto](http://gotocon.com/) series of conferences. Later this
month they are running [a full conference in
Amsterdam](http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2013/), and I’ll be doing a
keynote for them on Wednesday June 19. I’ll be doing my usual [suite of
talks](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SuiteOfTalks.html) format, but
haven’t yet decided which talks will go in the set. I hope to see some
of my regular readers there.
