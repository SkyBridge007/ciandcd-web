Slug: microservices-decentralized-governance

In this installment we talk about how microservices live in a [world of
decentralized
governance](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#DecentralizedGovernance).
Rather than having a governance group define standards for services,
services make their own decisions and are encouraged to share common
solutions. With this installment we also look at the [relationship
between microservices and
SOA](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#MicroservicesAndSoa).
