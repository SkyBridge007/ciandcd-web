As [reported by
Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/the-great-git-debate/)
we’re part of Y Combinator’s winter 2015 batch!

</p>

Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley based seed fund, provides mentorship,
advice and connections to a meticulously selected group of startups in
two batches each year. Previous startups that went to the program
include Dropbox, AirBnB, Stripe and Reddit. Y Combinator has also funded
some of the best tools for developer community - including Heroku,
CoreOS and Docker. Being selected by Y Combinator is a fantastic
opportunity to learn from successful startup founders and leverage the
experience of Y Combinators’ extensive network.
