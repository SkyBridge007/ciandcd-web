I've heard a couple of questions recently about coming up with a

standard story point mechanism for multiple teams using extreme

programming's planning approach. The hope is have several teams all

using equivalent story points, so that three story points of effort

on one team is the same as on another.

</p>

I think trying to come up with this at best of limited value, and

at worst dangerous.

</p>

The estimating system of extreme programming is based on

[XpVelocity](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/XpVelocity.html) and
[YesterdaysWeather](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/YesterdaysWeather.html).
Inherent

in this is the idea that when you make estimates, the actual units

you estimate aren't important - what's important is you estimate

by rough comparative value and use
[YesterdaysWeather](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/YesterdaysWeather.html)

for calibration.

</p>

In this situation the story points act as an anchor for the

feedback loop that Yesterday's Weather provides - nothing more.

Baked into them are all sorts of assumptions about the nature of

the team's task, the capability of the team, and whether the team

are optimistic or pessimistic estimators. Once you try to come up

with a standard across teams you are trying to normalize all of

these factors. Trying to do this sounds very hard to me, and I'm

not aware of anyone who has done this effectively. This doesn't

mean its impossible, it just means it's hard.

</p>

The dangerous aspect comes from once you have a standard unit for

measurement across teams, someone is inevitably going to use it to

compare the performance of teams. Even if everyone swears till they

are blue in the face that they won't use it for cross team

measurement, there will always be the suspicion that this will

happen eventually. This will cause teams to distort their

measurements so that it seems that they get more story points

done. My fear is that this will break the feedback loop of

yesterday's weather and knock the planning process off kilter. I'm

always suspicious about these things because while it would be

incredibly valuable to have a way to measure productivity I think

the nature of software is such that we
[CannotMeasureProductivity](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html).

</p>

So to be worth trying, this has to yield some valuable benefits -

but I don't see any. One reason that I've heard is to help people

move onto teams and estimate more quickly. But you can't estimate on

a new team until you get reasonably familiar with the problem and

the current code base. As you do that you'll also get a feel for the

relative sizes of story points on that team. We move people around

between projects at ThoughtWorks and I've never heard anyone

complain about difficulty of estimating when coming onto a new team

due to differences in story points.
